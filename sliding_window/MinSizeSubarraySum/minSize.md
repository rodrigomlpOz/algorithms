### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the **minimal length** of a **subarray** whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0`.

### Function Definition

```python
def minSubArrayLen(target: int, nums: list[int]) -> int:
    pass
```

### Function Calls

```python
# Test case 1: General case
target = 7
nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]
print(minSubArrayLen(target, nums))  # Output: 2 (subarray [4, 3])

# Test case 2: Small array where one element meets the target
target = 4
nums = [1, 4, 4]
print(minSubArrayLen(target, nums))  # Output: 1 (subarray [4])

# Test case 3: No valid subarray exists
target = 11
nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
print(minSubArrayLen(target, nums))  # Output: 0

# Test case 4: Larger array with varying numbers
target = 15
nums = [5, 1, 3, 5, 10, 7, 4, 9, 2]
print(minSubArrayLen(target, nums))  # Output: 2 (subarray [10, 7])
```

### High-Level Solution

The problem can be efficiently solved using the **sliding window** technique. Here's the high-level approach:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Use `left` and `right` pointers to define a sliding window over the array.
   
2. **Expand the Window**: Start by expanding the window (moving the `right` pointer) and keep adding elements to the current sum until the sum is greater than or equal to `target`.

3. **Shrink the Window**: Once the current sum is greater than or equal to `target`, attempt to shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer to the right, removing elements from the current sum, and checking if a smaller window still satisfies the condition.

4. **Track the Minimum Length**: Every time the sum of the current window is greater than or equal to `target`, record the length of the window. Continue adjusting the window until the entire array is processed.

5. **Edge Case**: If no such subarray is found, return `0`.

### Python Code Implementation

```python
def minSubArrayLen(target: int, nums: list[int]) -> int:
    pass
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sliding Window**: 
   - The `right` pointer moves through the array, expanding the window by adding elements to the `current_sum`.
   - Once `current_sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, the `left` pointer moves right to shrink the window while maintaining a sum greater than or equal to `target`.

2. **Track Minimum Length**: 
   - Every time a valid window (with sum â‰¥ target) is found, the size of the window (`right - left + 1`) is compared to the current minimum length, and if smaller, it's updated.

3. **Edge Case**:
   - If no valid subarray is found (i.e., `min_length` remains `float("inf")`), return `0`.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `nums` array. Both pointers (`left` and `right`) traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since only a few variables are used to store state.
