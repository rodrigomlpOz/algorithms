### Problem: Meeting Schedule

**Problem Statement:**
Given an array of meeting time intervals `[[start1, end1], [start2, end2], ...]` where `start_i < end_i`, determine if a person can attend all the meetings without any conflicts.

A meeting is represented by a start and end time, and two meetings conflict if one meeting starts before the previous one ends.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: intervals = [(0, 30), (5, 10), (15, 20)]
Output: false
Explanation:
- (0, 30) and (5, 10) will conflict
- (0, 30) and (15, 20) will conflict
```

### High-Level Solution:
1. **Sort the meetings:** First, sort the intervals by their start times. This ensures that when we check consecutive intervals, we only need to check if the current meeting starts before the previous meeting ends.
2. **Check for conflicts:** Once sorted, iterate through the sorted intervals. For each meeting, check if its start time is less than the end time of the previous meeting. If so, the meetings conflict, and return `false`.
3. **Return true if no conflicts are found.**

### Full Implementation:

```python
def canAttendMeetings(intervals):
    pass
```

### Function Calls with Test Cases:

```python
# Test Case 1
intervals1 = [(0, 30), (5, 10), (15, 20)]
print(f"Input: {intervals1}")
print(f"Output: {canAttendMeetings(intervals1)}")
# Expected Output: False (because of conflicts between (0, 30) and (5, 10), and (0, 30) and (15, 20))

# Test Case 2
intervals2 = [(7, 10), (2, 4)]
print(f"Input: {intervals2}")
print(f"Output: {canAttendMeetings(intervals2)}")
# Expected Output: True (No conflicts)

# Test Case 3
intervals3 = [(1, 4), (2, 3), (4, 5)]
print(f"Input: {intervals3}")
print(f"Output: {canAttendMeetings(intervals3)}")
# Expected Output: False (Conflict between (1, 4) and (2, 3))

# Test Case 4 (Edge Case: No meetings)
intervals4 = []
print(f"Input: {intervals4}")
print(f"Output: {canAttendMeetings(intervals4)}")
# Expected Output: True (No meetings, no conflicts)

# Test Case 5
intervals5 = [(5, 8), (9, 15)]
print(f"Input: {intervals5}")
print(f"Output: {canAttendMeetings(intervals5)}")
# Expected Output: True (No conflicts)
```

### Explanation of the Solution:
1. **Step 1 (Sorting):** We first sort the intervals by the start times. This ensures that we only need to compare consecutive meetings.
2. **Step 2 (Check for Conflicts):** As we iterate through the sorted intervals, we check if the start of the current meeting is earlier than the end of the previous meeting. If so, a conflict exists, and we return `false`.
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **No meetings:** If the input list is empty, the person can attend all the meetings (since there are none).
   - **No overlapping meetings:** If the meetings don't overlap, the person can attend all meetings, so return `true`.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the intervals takes `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of intervals.
- Checking for conflicts is `O(n)`, so the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.
