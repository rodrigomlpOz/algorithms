### Problem: 56. Merge Intervals

**Problem Statement:**
Given an array of intervals where each interval is represented as `[start_i, end_i]`, merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
Explanation: Intervals [1, 3] and [2, 6] overlap, so they are merged into [1, 6].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1, 4], [4, 5]]
Output: [[1, 5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1, 4] and [4, 5] are considered overlapping.
```

### High-Level Solution:
1. **Sort the intervals** by the start times. This allows you to easily check for overlaps between consecutive intervals.
2. **Merge intervals:** Iterate through the sorted intervals and check if the current interval overlaps with the previous one. If they overlap, merge them by updating the end of the previous interval.
3. **Return the result** after all the intervals are processed.

### Function Definition (Skeleton):
```python
def merge(intervals):
    # High-level idea:
    # 1. Sort intervals by their start values.
    # 2. Initialize a list for merged intervals.
    # 3. Iterate over the sorted intervals and merge overlapping intervals.
    pass
```

### Function Calls with Print Statements:
```python
# Test Case 1
intervals1 = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
print(f"Input: {intervals1}")
print(f"Output: {merge(intervals1)}")
# Expected Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]

# Test Case 2
intervals2 = [[1, 4], [4, 5]]
print(f"Input: {intervals2}")
print(f"Output: {merge(intervals2)}")
# Expected Output: [[1, 5]]

# Test Case 3
intervals3 = [[1, 10], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
print(f"Input: {intervals3}")
print(f"Output: {merge(intervals3)}")
# Expected Output: [[1, 10], [15, 18]]

# Test Case 4
intervals4 = [[1, 4], [5, 6], [7, 9]]
print(f"Input: {intervals4}")
print(f"Output: {merge(intervals4)}")
# Expected Output: [[1, 4], [5, 6], [7, 9]]

# Test Case 5
intervals5 = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
print(f"Input: {intervals5}")
print(f"Output: {merge(intervals5)}")
# Expected Output: [[1, 4]]
```

### Solution Explanation:
1. **Sorting:** First, sort the intervals by their start times. This makes it easy to check for overlapping intervals.
2. **Merging Intervals:** Start with the first interval, and for each subsequent interval, check if it overlaps with the last merged interval. If it does, update the end of the last merged interval to be the maximum of both intervals' ends. If it doesn't overlap, add the current interval to the merged list.
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Empty input list.
   - Non-overlapping intervals.
   - Completely overlapping intervals.

By calling the function with `print` statements, you can see how different sets of intervals are merged.
