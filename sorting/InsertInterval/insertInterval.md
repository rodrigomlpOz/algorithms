### Problem: 57. Insert Interval

**Problem Statement:**
You are given a sorted array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals`, where each interval is represented as `[start_i, end_i]`. You are also given a `newInterval` represented as `[start, end]` that needs to be inserted into `intervals`.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that the array remains sorted by `start_i`, and merge overlapping intervals if necessary. The array should still have no overlapping intervals after the insertion.

You do not need to modify the input array in place. You can return a new array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1, 3], [6, 9]], newInterval = [2, 5]
Output: [[1, 5], [6, 9]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1, 2], [3, 5], [6, 7], [8, 10], [12, 16]], newInterval = [4, 8]
Output: [[1, 2], [3, 10], [12, 16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4, 8] overlaps with [3, 5], [6, 7], [8, 10].
```

### High-Level Solution:
1. **Initialize an empty list:** Start with an empty list to store the result.
2. **Add all intervals before the `newInterval`:** Iterate through the `intervals` list, and add all intervals that end before the `newInterval` starts.
3. **Merge overlapping intervals:** For any interval that overlaps with `newInterval`, merge them by adjusting the start and end times.
4. **Add all remaining intervals:** Add any intervals that come after the merged `newInterval` to the result.
5. **Return the result.**

### Full Implementation:

```python
def insert(intervals, newInterval):
    pass
```

### Function Calls with Test Cases:

```python
# Test Case 1
intervals1 = [[1, 3], [6, 9]]
newInterval1 = [2, 5]
print(f"Input: intervals = {intervals1}, newInterval = {newInterval1}")
print(f"Output: {insert(intervals1, newInterval1)}")
# Expected Output: [[1, 5], [6, 9]]

# Test Case 2
intervals2 = [[1, 2], [3, 5], [6, 7], [8, 10], [12, 16]]
newInterval2 = [4, 8]
print(f"Input: intervals = {intervals2}, newInterval = {newInterval2}")
print(f"Output: {insert(intervals2, newInterval2)}")
# Expected Output: [[1, 2], [3, 10], [12, 16]]

# Test Case 3
intervals3 = []
newInterval3 = [4, 8]
print(f"Input: intervals = {intervals3}, newInterval = {newInterval3}")
print(f"Output: {insert(intervals3, newInterval3)}")
# Expected Output: [[4, 8]]

# Test Case 4
intervals4 = [[1, 2], [5, 6]]
newInterval4 = [3, 4]
print(f"Input: intervals = {intervals4}, newInterval = {newInterval4}")
print(f"Output: {insert(intervals4, newInterval4)}")
# Expected Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
```

### Explanation of the Solution:
1. **Step 1 (Non-overlapping Intervals Before):** We loop through the input `intervals` and add all intervals that do not overlap with `newInterval` (i.e., intervals that end before `newInterval` starts) to the result list.
   
2. **Step 2 (Merge Overlapping Intervals):** Once we reach intervals that overlap with `newInterval` (i.e., intervals where `start <= newInterval.end`), we merge them by adjusting the start and end of `newInterval` to cover the merged range.

3. **Step 3 (Non-overlapping Intervals After):** After merging, we add any remaining intervals that come after the merged interval to the result.

4. **Edge Cases Handled:**
   - Empty input (`intervals = []`).
   - `newInterval` being added without merging any intervals.
   - No overlaps at all, `newInterval` is added in the appropriate place.

This ensures the intervals are merged properly and returned in a sorted order without overlaps.
