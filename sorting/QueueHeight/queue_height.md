### Problem Statement:
Given an array of people represented by pairs of integers `(h, k)` where:
- `h` is the height of the person.
- `k` is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to `h`.

Your task is to reconstruct the queue of people such that the given conditions are satisfied for each person.

### Functional Definition:
1. **Function Name:** `reconstructQueue`
2. **Input Parameters:**
   - `people` (List of pairs of integers): Each pair `[h, k]` represents a person where `h` is the height and `k` is the number of people in front of them who are taller or have the same height.
   
3. **Output:**
   - A list of pairs of integers representing the reconstructed queue, where the conditions specified by `k` are satisfied.

4. **Example Call:**
   ```python
   people = [[7, 0], [4, 4], [7, 1], [5, 0], [6, 1], [5, 2]]
   result = reconstructQueue(people)
   # Output: [[5, 0], [7, 0], [5, 2], [6, 1], [4, 4], [7, 1]]
   ```

### High-Level Solution:
1. **Sorting:**
   - First, sort the list of people in descending order by height `h`. If two people have the same height, sort them by the number of people `k` in ascending order.
   - This way, when we start placing people in the queue, we are always dealing with the tallest available person, which makes it easier to place them correctly based on the `k` value.

2. **Reconstructing the Queue:**
   - Initialize an empty list `output` to hold the reconstructed queue.
   - Iterate through the sorted list of people and insert each person into the `output` list at the index specified by their `k` value.
   - Since the list is being built from tallest to shortest, when inserting a shorter person, the previously inserted taller people will already be in their correct positions.

3. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all the people, the `output` list will represent the reconstructed queue.


### Explanation:
1. **Sorting:**
   - The `sort` function orders the list primarily by height in descending order (`-x[0]`) and secondarily by `k` in ascending order (`x[1]`).
   
2. **Queue Reconstruction:**
   - As we insert each person into the `output` list according to their `k` value, we ensure that the queue conditions are satisfied.
   - Since taller people are placed first, when a shorter person is inserted, they go in front of the correct number of taller or equally tall people as specified by `k`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** The sorting step takes `O(n log n)` and the subsequent insertion step takes `O(n^2)` in the worst case, where `n` is the number of people. Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the space required to store the `output` list.

- Let's consider an example where the second for loop (the loop where we insert each person into the output list based on their `k` value) is necessary after the sorting step.

### Example Input:
```python
people = [[5, 2], [7, 0], [5, 0], [6, 1], [4, 4], [7, 1]]
```

### Step 1: Sorting
First, we sort the list by height in descending order, and for people with the same height, by `k` value in ascending order:
```python
sorted_people = [[7, 0], [7, 1], [6, 1], [5, 0], [5, 2], [4, 4]]
```

### Step 2: Insertion Using the For Loop
Now, we'll insert each person into the output list based on their `k` value.

1. **Insert `[7, 0]`**:
   - `k = 0`: Insert at index 0.
   - Output list: `[[7, 0]]`

2. **Insert `[7, 1]`**:
   - `k = 1`: Insert at index 1.
   - Output list: `[[7, 0], [7, 1]]`

3. **Insert `[6, 1]`**:
   - `k = 1`: Insert at index 1.
   - Output list: `[[7, 0], [6, 1], [7, 1]]`
   - Notice how `[6, 1]` is placed at index 1, pushing `[7, 1]` to index 2.

4. **Insert `[5, 0]`**:
   - `k = 0`: Insert at index 0.
   - Output list: `[[5, 0], [7, 0], [6, 1], [7, 1]]`
   - Notice how `[5, 0]` is placed at the beginning, pushing everyone else to the right.

5. **Insert `[5, 2]`**:
   - `k = 2`: Insert at index 2.
   - Output list: `[[5, 0], [7, 0], [5, 2], [6, 1], [7, 1]]`
   - Notice how `[5, 2]` is placed at index 2, pushing `[6, 1]` and `[7, 1]` to the right.

6. **Insert `[4, 4]`**:
   - `k = 4`: Insert at index 4.
   - Output list: `[[5, 0], [7, 0], [5, 2], [6, 1], [4, 4], [7, 1]]`
   - Notice how `[4, 4]` is placed at index 4, pushing `[7, 1]` to index 5.

### Final Output:
```python
[[5, 0], [7, 0], [5, 2], [6, 1], [4, 4], [7, 1]]
```

### Why the For Loop is Necessary
- **Sorting Alone:** The sorting step puts the people in an order that allows us to consider each person in the correct sequence (from the tallest to the shortest). However, this doesn't account for placing them in the exact position required by their `k` value.
- **Insertion with the For Loop:** The for loop ensures that each person is placed in the exact position according to their `k` value, respecting the number of taller or equally tall people in front of them.

### Specific Scenario:
Look at the insertion of `[5, 2]`:
- After sorting, `[5, 2]` is the 5th element in the list, but its correct position in the queue should be the 3rd index (after two people taller than or equal to 5 are in front). The for loop places `[5, 2]` in the correct position by shifting other elements as needed.

Without the second for loop, you wouldn't be able to ensure that each person is placed correctly in the queue based on their `k` value. Sorting alone can't handle this because it doesn't consider the final dynamic positions required for each element.
