## Problem Statement

Given a binary search tree (BST) and an integer \( k \), write a function to find the \( k \) largest elements in the BST. The elements should be returned in decreasing order.

### Function Signature

```python
def find_k_largest_in_bst(tree, k):
    pass
```

### Function Calls

```python
# Example usage:
# Assuming TreeNode is defined as follows:
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, data: int, left: 'TreeNode' = None, right: 'TreeNode' = None):
#         self.data = data
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

# Example BST:
#         19
#        /  \
#       7    43
#      /    /  \
#     3    23   47
#          /   /  \
#         21  37  53
#               \
#               41

# Tree structure creation
tree = TreeNode(19, 
                TreeNode(7, TreeNode(3)),
                TreeNode(43, 
                         TreeNode(23, TreeNode(21)), 
                         TreeNode(47, TreeNode(37, None, TreeNode(41)), TreeNode(53))))

# Find the 3 largest elements
print(find_k_largest_in_bst(tree, 3))  # Output: [53, 47, 43]
```

### High-Level Approach

1. **Reverse Inorder Traversal**: The inorder traversal of a BST yields the elements in ascending order. To find the largest elements in descending order, perform a reverse inorder traversal (right, root, left).

2. **Collecting Elements**: During the traversal, maintain a list to collect the largest elements. Stop collecting once you have collected \( k \) elements.

3. **Stopping Condition**: Ensure the traversal stops as soon as \( k \) elements are collected, optimizing the process by avoiding unnecessary traversal of nodes.

4. **Helper Function**: Use a helper function that performs the traversal and keeps track of the count of collected elements.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the largest \( k \) elements in the BST without traversing more nodes than necessary.
