### Problem Description:
Given a non-negative floating-point number `num`, your task is to find the square root of `num` with a specified precision. The result should be a floating-point number that approximates the square root of `num` to within a given tolerance (e.g., 0.001).

You are to implement this solution using a binary search approach.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: num = 6
Output: 2.449 (approximately)
```

### Explanation:
The square root of 6 is approximately 2.449. The goal is to compute this value using binary search, ensuring the result is accurate to within 0.001.

### Function Signature:
Here is the expected function signature in Python:
```python
def val_equal_index(num: float) -> float:
    pass
```

### Function Calls:
```python
num = 6
ans = val_equal_index(num)
print(ans)  # Expected output: Approximately 2.449
```

### High-Level Approach:
1. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - Binary search is applied between `0` and `num` (the range of possible square roots).
   - The midpoint of this range is recalculated in each iteration.
   - If `mid * mid` is greater than `num`, the search range is reduced by adjusting the high boundary.
   - If `mid * mid` is less than `num`, the search range is reduced by adjusting the low boundary.

2. **Precision Control:**
   - The loop terminates when the difference between `mid * mid` and `num` is within a small tolerance (e.g., 0.001). This controls the precision of the result.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The input `num` could be `0` or `1`, which have simple square roots.
   - The input might be a perfect square or a large floating-point number.

This problem involves applying binary search to efficiently compute the square root of a floating-point number, achieving a time complexity of `O(log n)` with respect to the precision level.
