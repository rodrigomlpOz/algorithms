### Problem Statement
You are given a sorted list of integers `A` and a target integer `x`. Your task is to find the first occurrence of the target integer in the list using an efficient search algorithm. If the target integer is not present in the list, return `-1`.

### Problem Definition
Given a sorted list of integers `A` and an integer `x`, implement a function `findFirstOccurrence` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in `A`. If `x` is not found in the list, the function should return `-1`.

- **Input:**
  - `A`: A sorted list of integers.
  - `x`: An integer representing the target value to find.

- **Output:**
  - The index of the first occurrence of `x` in `A`, or `-1` if `x` is not found.

### Function Signature
```python
def findFirstOccurrence(A: List[int], x: int) -> int:
```

### Example
```python
# Example 1:
# Input: A = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], x = 2
# Output: 1

# Example 2:
# Input: A = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], x = 4
# Output: -1
```

### High-Level Solution
1. **Initialize the Search Space:**
   - Start with two pointers `left` and `right` representing the bounds of the search space, initially set to `0` and `len(A) - 1` respectively.

2. **Binary Search for the First Occurrence:**
   - Use binary search to efficiently locate the target integer `x`.
   - Compute the mid-point `mid` and compare `A[mid]` with `x`.
   - If `A[mid]` equals `x`, record the current `mid` index as a potential result, but continue to search in the left half by setting `right` to `mid - 1`. This step ensures that you find the first occurrence.
   - If `A[mid]` is greater than `x`, discard the right half of the search space by setting `right` to `mid - 1`.
   - If `A[mid]` is less than `x`, discard the left half by setting `left` to `mid + 1`.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - If the target `x` is found during the search, the result will hold the index of the first occurrence. If `x` is not found, return `-1`.

### Function Call Example
```python
# Example usage:
A = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x = 2
print(findFirstOccurrence(A, x))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n), where `n` is the number of elements in the list. This is because binary search is used to efficiently locate the target.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the search is performed in place with a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures that the first occurrence of the target integer `x` is found in an optimal way, even for large sorted arrays.
