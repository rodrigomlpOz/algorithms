Certainly! I'll retain the comprehensive explanation provided earlier, remove the implementation code, and add function definitions along with sample function calls to help illustrate how you might interact with the `partition` function. Here's the updated explanation:

Sure, I'd be happy to explain Problem 86: **Partition List**. Let's break down the problem statement, understand the requirements, and walk through the provided examples to clarify how the solution should work.

## **Problem Overview**

You are given:

- **A linked list**: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence. For example, `[1,4,3,2,5,2]` represents a linked list where `1` is the head, followed by `4`, then `3`, and so on.
- **A value `x`**: An integer used to partition the linked list.

**Objective**: Rearrange the linked list so that all nodes with values **less than `x`** come **before** nodes with values **greater than or equal to `x`**. Importantly, **the original relative order of the nodes in each partition must be preserved**.

## **Key Points to Understand**

1. **Linked List Structure**: Unlike arrays, linked lists consist of nodes where each node points to the next node. This structure allows for efficient insertions and deletions but requires careful handling when rearranging nodes.

2. **Partitioning Criteria**:
   - **Nodes < `x`**: These nodes should appear at the beginning of the linked list.
   - **Nodes ≥ `x`**: These nodes should appear after all nodes that are less than `x`.

3. **Preserving Relative Order**: Within each partition (nodes less than `x` and nodes greater than or equal to `x`), the original order of nodes must remain unchanged.

## **Detailed Explanation with Examples**

Let's walk through the provided examples to see how the partitioning works.

### **Example 1**

- **Input**:
  - Linked List: `[1,4,3,2,5,2]`
  - `x = 3`
  
- **Process**:
  1. **Identify Nodes < 3**:
     - `1`, `2`, `2`
  2. **Identify Nodes ≥ 3**:
     - `4`, `3`, `5`
  3. **Preserve Order**:
     - Nodes less than `3` remain in the order `1 → 2 → 2`.
     - Nodes greater than or equal to `3` remain in the order `4 → 3 → 5`.
  4. **Combine Partitions**:
     - Combine the two sequences: `1 → 2 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 5`

- **Output**: `[1,2,2,4,3,5]`

### **Example 2**

- **Input**:
  - Linked List: `[2,1]`
  - `x = 2`
  
- **Process**:
  1. **Identify Nodes < 2**:
     - `1`
  2. **Identify Nodes ≥ 2**:
     - `2`
  3. **Preserve Order**:
     - Nodes less than `2`: `1`
     - Nodes greater than or equal to `2`: `2`
  4. **Combine Partitions**:
     - Combine the two sequences: `1 → 2`

- **Output**: `[1,2]`

## **Visual Representation**

Let's visualize the first example to better understand the partitioning.

### **Initial Linked List**

```
1 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 5 → 2
```

### **After Partitioning**

1. **Nodes < 3**:
   ```
   1 → 2 → 2
   ```
2. **Nodes ≥ 3**:
   ```
   4 → 3 → 5
   ```
3. **Combined**:
   ```
   1 → 2 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 5
   ```

## **Approach to Solve the Problem**

To solve this problem, you can use two separate lists to maintain the order of nodes less than `x` and nodes greater than or equal to `x`. Here's a high-level approach:

1. **Initialize Two Dummy Nodes**:
   - `before_head`: A dummy node to start the list of nodes less than `x`.
   - `after_head`: A dummy node to start the list of nodes greater than or equal to `x`.

2. **Traverse the Original List**:
   - For each node:
     - If the node's value is less than `x`, append it to the `before` list.
     - Otherwise, append it to the `after` list.

3. **Combine the Two Lists**:
   - Link the end of the `before` list to the head of the `after` list.
   - Ensure the end of the `after` list points to `null` to terminate the linked list.

4. **Return the New Head**:
   - The head of the partitioned list is the node following `before_head`.

### **Why Use Dummy Nodes?**

Dummy nodes simplify edge cases, such as when one of the partitions is empty. They act as placeholders that make it easier to build and merge the two lists without worrying about whether the list is empty initially.

## **Time and Space Complexity**

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. You traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since you create two separate lists to hold the nodes.

## **Conclusion**

The Partition List problem requires rearranging a linked list based on a pivot value `x` while maintaining the original relative order of the nodes in each partition. By using two separate lists and then combining them, you can efficiently achieve the desired partitioning.

If you're interested in interacting with this functionality, here's how you might define the necessary functions and make calls to them:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def partition(head, x):
    # Implementation goes here
    pass  # Placeholder for the actual implementation

# Helper function to create a linked list from a list
def create_linked_list(lst):
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy
    for value in lst:
        current.next = ListNode(value)
        current = current.next
    return dummy.next

# Helper function to convert linked list to list for easy verification
def linked_list_to_list(head):
    result = []
    current = head
    while current:
        result.append(current.val)
        current = current.next
    return result

# Example Calls
# Example 1
head1 = create_linked_list([1,4,3,2,5,2])
x1 = 3
new_head1 = partition(head1, x1)
print(linked_list_to_list(new_head1))  # Expected Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]

# Example 2
head2 = create_linked_list([2,1])
x2 = 2
new_head2 = partition(head2, x2)
print(linked_list_to_list(new_head2))  # Expected Output: [1,2]
```

### **Explanation of the Added Code**

1. **ListNode Class**:
   - Defines the structure of a node in the linked list, containing a value and a pointer to the next node.

2. **partition Function**:
   - Placeholder for the actual implementation of the partitioning logic. You would replace the `pass` statement with the logic discussed earlier.

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - `create_linked_list(lst)`: Converts a Python list to a linked list, facilitating easy creation of test cases.
   - `linked_list_to_list(head)`: Converts a linked list back to a Python list, making it easier to verify the output.

4. **Example Calls**:
   - Demonstrates how to create linked lists from input lists, call the `partition` function with a given `x`, and print the resulting linked list in list form for verification.

By setting up your functions and helper methods in this way, you can efficiently test and verify your `partition` function against various test cases.
