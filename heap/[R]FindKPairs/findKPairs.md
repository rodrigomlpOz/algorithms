## **Problem Statement**

### **Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums**

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` sorted in **non-decreasing order** and an integer `k`.

Define a pair `(u, v)` which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.

**Return the `k` pairs `(u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (uk, vk)` with the smallest sums.**

nums2 = [2,4,6]
k = 3
```

**Output:**
```python
[[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]]
```

**Explanation:**
The first 3 pairs are returned from the sequence:
```
[1,2], [1,4], [1,6], [7,2], [7,4], [11,2], [7,6], [11,4], [11,6]
```

## **High-Level Solution**

To efficiently solve the **Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums** problem, we'll utilize a **Min-Heap (Priority Queue)** combined with **Heap Push/Pop Operations**. This approach ensures that we always process the next smallest possible pair, optimizing both time and space complexity.

### **1. Overview of the Approach**

- **Heap Utilization:**  
  Use a min-heap to keep track of the next smallest pair. Initially, pair the first element of `nums1` with each element of `nums2` and add these pairs to the heap.

- **Heap Operations:**  
  - **Pop:** Extract the smallest sum pair from the heap.
  - **Push:** If possible, add the next pair from `nums1` to the heap by incrementing the index in `nums1`.

- **Termination Conditions:**  
  - The heap is empty.
  - `k` pairs have been extracted.

### **2. Step-by-Step Solution**

#### **Step 1: Edge Case Handling**

- If either `nums1` or `nums2` is empty, or `k` is zero, return an empty list as no pairs can be formed.

#### **Step 2: Initialize the Min-Heap**

- Initialize a min-heap (priority queue).
- Pair the first element of `nums1` with the first `min(k, len(nums2))` elements of `nums2` and add these pairs to the heap.
- Each heap element will be a tuple containing:
  - The sum of the pair.
  - The index of the element in `nums1`.
  - The index of the element in `nums2`.

#### **Step 3: Extract Pairs from the Heap**

- Initialize an empty result list to store the k smallest pairs.
- While the heap is not empty and the number of extracted pairs is less than `k`:
  1. **Pop the Smallest Pair:**  
     Extract the pair with the smallest sum from the heap.
  
  2. **Add to Result:**  
     Append this pair to the result list.
  
  3. **Push the Next Pair:**  
     If there is a next element in `nums1` for the current `nums2` index, create a new pair by incrementing the `nums1` index and push it into the heap.

#### **Step 4: Return the Result**

- After extracting `k` pairs or exhausting all possible pairs, return the result list.

### **3. Why Use a Min-Heap?**

- **Efficiency in Retrieval:**  
  A min-heap allows for constant time retrieval of the smallest sum pair, which is essential for ensuring that pairs are processed in order of their sums.

- **Controlled Expansion:**  
  By only pushing the next possible pair into the heap when a pair is popped, we avoid generating all possible pairs upfront, thereby optimizing space.

- **Optimal Time Complexity:**  
  The heap operations ensure that we process only the necessary pairs, leading to an overall time complexity of **O(k log k)**.

### **4. Time and Space Complexity**

- **Time Complexity:**  
  - **Heap Initialization:** O(min(k, n)) where `n` is the length of `nums2`.
  - **Heap Operations:** Each of the `k` operations involves a heap push and pop, each taking O(log k) time.
  - **Overall:** O(min(k, n) + k log k)

- **Space Complexity:**  
  - **Heap Size:** O(min(k, n)) since we only keep the first `min(k, n)` pairs in the heap.
  - **Result Storage:** O(k) to store the resulting pairs.
  - **Overall:** O(k)

## **Illustrative Python Implementation**

Below is a Python implementation of the **Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums** problem using a min-heap approach.

```python
from typing import List
import heapq

def k_smallest_pairs(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Finds the k pairs with the smallest sums from two sorted arrays.

    Args:
        nums1 (List[int]): First sorted integer array.
        nums2 (List[int]): Second sorted integer array.
        k (int): Number of pairs to return.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: List containing k pairs with the smallest sums.
    """
    # Edge Case: If either array is empty or k is 0, return an empty list
    if not nums1 or not nums2 or k == 0:
        return []

    # Initialize the min-heap
    min_heap = []
    # Push the first pair (nums1[0], nums2[0 to min(k, len(nums2))-1])
    for j in range(min(k, len(nums2))):
        # Each heap element is a tuple: (sum, index in nums1, index in nums2)
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (nums1[0] + nums2[j], 0, j))
    
    result = []
    
    # Extract the k smallest pairs
    while min_heap and len(result) < k:
        current_sum, i, j = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        result.append([nums1[i], nums2[j]])
        
        # If there is a next element in nums1, push the new pair into the heap
        if i + 1 < len(nums1):
            new_sum = nums1[i + 1] + nums2[j]
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (new_sum, i + 1, j))
    
    return result

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example 1
    nums1 = [1,7,11]
    nums2 = [2,4,6]
    k = 3
    print(k_smallest_pairs(nums1, nums2, k))  # Output: [[1,2],[1,4],[1,6]]

    # Example 2
    nums1 = [1,1,2]
    nums2 = [1,2,3]
    k = 2
    print(k_smallest_pairs(nums1, nums2, k))  # Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]

    # Example 3
    nums1 = [1,2]
    nums2 = [3]
    k = 3
    print(k_smallest_pairs(nums1, nums2, k))  # Output: [[1,3],[2,3]]

    # Example 4
    nums1 = []
    nums2 = [1,2,3]
    k = 3
    print(k_smallest_pairs(nums1, nums2, k))  # Output: []

    # Example 5
    nums1 = [1,2,3]
    nums2 = [1,2,3]
    k = 5
    print(k_smallest_pairs(nums1, nums2, k))  # Output: [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[1,3],[2,2]]
```

## **Detailed Explanation of the Solution**

### **1. Handling Edge Cases**

Before proceeding with the main logic, the function checks for edge cases:

- **Empty Arrays:**  
  If either `nums1` or `nums2` is empty, no pairs can be formed. Thus, the function returns an empty list.

- **Zero Pairs Requested:**  
  If `k` is zero, there's no need to find any pairs, so the function returns an empty list.

### **2. Initializing the Min-Heap**

- **Purpose:**  
  The min-heap is used to efficiently retrieve the next smallest pair based on the sum of its elements.

- **Process:**  
  - Iterate through the first `min(k, len(nums2))` elements of `nums2`.
  - For each element in this range, create a pair with the first element of `nums1` (`nums1[0]`) and push a tuple into the heap containing:
    - The sum of the pair (`nums1[0] + nums2[j]`).
    - The current index in `nums1` (`0`).
    - The current index in `nums2` (`j`).

- **Rationale:**  
  Since both arrays are sorted, the smallest possible sums will involve the smallest elements from both arrays. By pairing `nums1[0]` with elements of `nums2`, we ensure that the initial heap contains the smallest possible pairs.

### **3. Extracting Pairs from the Heap**

- **Loop Condition:**  
  Continue extracting pairs until either the heap is empty or `k` pairs have been found.

- **Process:**
  1. **Pop the Smallest Pair:**  
     Extract the tuple with the smallest sum from the heap using `heapq.heappop(min_heap)`.
  
  2. **Add to Result:**  
     Append the corresponding pair `[nums1[i], nums2[j]]` to the `result` list.
  
  3. **Push the Next Pair:**  
     - If there exists a next element in `nums1` (i.e., `i + 1 < len(nums1)`), create a new pair by pairing `nums1[i + 1]` with `nums2[j]`.
     - Push this new tuple `(nums1[i + 1] + nums2[j], i + 1, j)` into the heap.

- **Rationale:**  
  By always pairing the next element in `nums1` with the current element in `nums2`, we ensure that all potential pairs are considered in order of their sums without having to generate all possible pairs upfront.

### **4. Termination and Result Compilation**

- The loop terminates when either:
  - The heap is empty (i.e., all possible pairs have been considered).
  - `k` pairs have been found.

- The function then returns the `result` list containing the `k` pairs with the smallest sums.

---

## **Why This Approach Works**

- **Sorted Arrays:**  
  Since both `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted in non-decreasing order, the smallest possible sums are generated by pairing the smallest elements from each array.

- **Heap Efficiency:**  
  The min-heap ensures that the next smallest sum pair is always at the top, allowing for efficient retrieval and processing.

- **Avoiding Redundant Pairs:**  
  By only pushing the next element from `nums1` with the current element from `nums2`, we avoid considering pairs that would result in larger sums prematurely.

- **Optimal Time Complexity:**  
  The use of a heap ensures that we do not have to generate all possible pairs, which would be computationally expensive for large arrays. Instead, we only process up to `k` pairs, each operation taking logarithmic time relative to the heap size.

---

## **Alternative Approach: Using BFS with a Min-Heap**

Another efficient method to solve this problem involves treating the pair formation as a BFS (Breadth-First Search) problem where each level explores the next possible smallest sum pair.

### **Steps:**

1. **Initialize a Min-Heap:**
   - Start by pushing the first pair `(nums1[0], nums2[0])` into the heap along with their indices.

2. **Use a Set to Track Visited Pairs:**
   - To avoid pushing the same pair multiple times, maintain a set that keeps track of the indices that have already been pushed to the heap.

3. **Iterate to Find k Pairs:**
   - Pop the smallest pair from the heap and add it to the result.
   - Push the next pair from `nums1` and the next pair from `nums2` into the heap, ensuring they haven't been visited before.

4. **Repeat Until k Pairs are Found:**
   - Continue the process until you've found `k` pairs or exhausted all possible pairs.

### **Pros and Cons:**

- **Pros:**
  - Ensures that all possible smallest sum pairs are considered.
  - Efficient for cases where `k` is much smaller than the total number of possible pairs.

- **Cons:**
  - Requires additional space to track visited pairs.
  - Slightly more complex to implement compared to the initial approach.

## **Final Thoughts**

The **Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums** problem is efficiently solvable using a min-heap combined with strategic pair generation. By leveraging the sorted nature of the input arrays, we can ensure optimal performance even with large input sizes. This approach guarantees that the `k` smallest sum pairs are found without the need to generate and sort all possible pairs, thereby saving both time and space.
