### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of integers and an integer `k`, which represents the size of a sliding window, find the maximum value in each sliding window of size `k` as the window moves from left to right across the array.

### Function Definition
```python
def maxSlidingWindowHeap(nums, k):
    """
    Finds the maximum value in each sliding window of size k using a max-heap.
    
    Args:
    nums (List[int]): The list of integers.
    k (int): The size of the sliding window.
    
    Returns:
    List[int]: A list containing the maximum values for each sliding window.
    """
```

### Function Call Examples
```python
nums = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
k = 3
print(maxSlidingWindowHeap(nums, k))  # Expected output: [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]
```

### High-Level Solution
1. **Edge Case Handling**: If `nums` is empty or `k` is zero, return an empty list.
2. **Heap Initialization**: Use a max-heap (implemented with negative values to simulate max behavior using Python's `heapq`, which is a min-heap by default) to store the values along with their indices.
3. **Iterate Over the Array**:
   - Push each element onto the heap with its negative value to maintain max-heap behavior.
   - Remove elements from the heap if their indices fall outside the current sliding window.
   - Once the sliding window is fully within bounds (when `i >= k - 1`), add the maximum element (negating the top of the heap) to the result list.
4. **Return the Result List**: After processing all elements, the list contains the maximum values for each sliding window.

This approach ensures efficient management of the heap for dynamic maximum retrieval as the sliding window progresses through the array.

No, you should not replace the `while` loop with an `if` statement in this code. The `while` loop is necessary because there may be multiple elements at the top of the heap that are no longer within the current sliding window. Replacing it with an `if` statement could result in incorrect outputs, as it would only remove one out-of-window element per iteration, potentially leaving others behind.

### Why While Loop
1. **Multiple Out-of-Window Elements**: The heap may contain several elements whose indices are outside the current window. These elements could be at the top of the heap due to the heap's ordering properties. The `while` loop ensures that all such elements are removed before proceeding.

2. **Heap Structure**: A heap does not store elements in a fully sorted order; it only guarantees that the smallest (or largest, in a max-heap) element is at the root. Therefore, you need to repeatedly check and remove the root element until it represents a valid index within the current window.

**Example to Illustrate the Issue**:

Suppose you have the following `nums` array and `k` value:

```python
nums = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5]
k = 2
```

At some point during the iterations, your heap might look like this (represented as a list of tuples `(-value, index)`):

```python
[(-9, 0), (-8, 1), (-7, 2)]
```

If you're at index `i = 3`, your current window includes indices `2` and `3`. The elements `(-9, 0)` and `(-8, 1)` are outside the current window. Using an `if` statement would only remove `(-9, 0)`, leaving `(-8, 1)` still in the heap and potentially causing incorrect results.

**Correct Approach**:

Keep the `while` loop to ensure all out-of-window elements are removed:

```python
while max_heap[0][1] < i - k + 1:
    heapq.heappop(max_heap)
```

**Summary**:

- **Do not replace** the `while` loop with an `if` statement.
- The `while` loop is necessary to maintain the correctness of the algorithm.
- Using an `if` statement can lead to incorrect maximum values for the sliding windows.
