### Problem Statement:
Given an array of meeting time intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start, end]`, your task is to determine the minimum number of meeting rooms required to accommodate all the meetings.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
intervals = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
```
**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:**  
You need two meeting rooms to hold the meetings because the first meeting overlaps with both the second and third meetings.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
intervals = [[7, 10], [2, 4]]
```
**Output:** `1`

**Explanation:**  
You only need one meeting room since the meetings do not overlap.

### Function Definition:

```python
def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals):
    """
    Function to determine the minimum number of meeting rooms required.
    
    Args:
    intervals: List[List[int]] - A list of meeting time intervals.
    
    Returns:
    int - The minimum number of meeting rooms required.
    """
    pass  # Implementation will go here

### Function Calls:

# Test Case 1
intervals = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
print(minMeetingRooms(intervals))  # Expected output: 2

# Test Case 2
intervals = [[7, 10], [2, 4]]
print(minMeetingRooms(intervals))  # Expected output: 1
```

### High-Level Solution:

1. **Sort the Meetings by Start Time:**
   - First, sort the meetings in ascending order of their start times. This helps in scheduling the meetings efficiently.

2. **Use a Min-Heap to Track End Times:**
   - The key insight is to track the end times of meetings using a min-heap. The min-heap keeps track of the meeting rooms that are currently occupied and their corresponding end times.
   - As we iterate over the sorted meetings, for each meeting:
     - If the meeting can start after the earliest ending meeting (i.e., if the start time of the current meeting is greater than or equal to the minimum end time), we reuse the room by popping the top of the heap.
     - Otherwise, we need a new room, and we push the end time of the current meeting onto the heap.

3. **Final Result:**
   - The size of the heap at the end represents the minimum number of rooms needed because each element in the heap corresponds to an active meeting occupying a room.

### Steps:

1. **Sort Intervals:**
   - First, sort the meeting intervals by their start time.

2. **Heap Operations:**
   - Initialize an empty heap (`free_rooms`).
   - Push the end time of the first meeting into the heap.
   - For every subsequent meeting:
     - If the current meeting starts after or when the earliest meeting ends, pop the top of the heap.
     - Push the current meetingâ€™s end time into the heap (whether reusing a room or adding a new one).
   
3. **Return Result:**
   - The size of the heap at the end gives the minimum number of meeting rooms required.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:**  
  - Sorting the meetings takes **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of meetings.
  - For each meeting, inserting and removing elements from the heap takes **O(log k)**, where `k` is the size of the heap, which is at most `n` in the worst case. Thus, iterating over all meetings takes **O(n log n)**.
  - Overall, the time complexity is **O(n log n)**.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  - The heap stores at most `n` meeting end times, so the space complexity is **O(n)**.

This approach ensures an efficient solution to the problem of finding the minimum number of meeting rooms required for the given intervals.
