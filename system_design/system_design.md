If you have 1 month to prepare for system design interviews, it's important to focus on key areas that are commonly asked. Here's a structured approach:

### Week 1: Core Fundamentals
Focus on foundational concepts and simpler system design questions.

1. **Design a URL shortener (like bit.ly)**  
   - Covers: Database design, unique ID generation, caching, scalability.

2. **Design a file storage system (like Dropbox or Google Drive)**  
   - Covers: File storage, synchronization, consistency, metadata management.

3. **Design a caching system (e.g., for a social media feed)**  
   - Covers: Caching strategies (LRU, LFU), cache invalidation, load balancing.

4. **Design a rate limiter**  
   - Covers: Traffic control, distributed rate limiting, real-time constraints.

### Week 2: Scalability and Distributed Systems
Dive into more advanced, distributed systems where scale is a factor.

5. **Design a messaging system (like Slack or WhatsApp)**  
   - Covers: Real-time communication, message queues, data storage for chat history, fault tolerance.

6. **Design a scalable search engine (like Google Search)**  
   - Covers: Indexing, ranking algorithms, crawling, load balancing, horizontal scaling.

7. **Design a content delivery network (CDN)**  
   - Covers: Caching, geo-replication, latency optimization, request routing.

8. **Design a notification system (like Facebook notifications)**  
   - Covers: Event-driven systems, messaging queues, push vs. pull notifications.

### Week 3: Advanced Topics
Start practicing more complex, end-to-end systems.

9. **Design an e-commerce system (like Amazon)**  
   - Covers: Shopping cart, inventory management, product catalog, payment systems.

10. **Design a ride-hailing service (like Uber)**  
   - Covers: Real-time location tracking, matching algorithms, maps integration, pricing models, high-availability.

11. **Design a video streaming platform (like YouTube or Netflix)**  
   - Covers: Content delivery, buffering, video encoding, load distribution, recommendations.

12. **Design a recommendation system (like YouTube or Netflix recommendations)**  
   - Covers: Machine learning at scale, ranking algorithms, caching, user personalization.

### Week 4: Mock Interviews & Gaps
Use this week to simulate the interview experience and shore up weak spots.

13. **Design a social media feed system (like Facebook or Twitter)**  
   - Covers: News feed algorithms, sharding, sorting, real-time updates, content ranking.

14. **Design a metrics monitoring system (like Prometheus)**  
   - Covers: Time-series databases, distributed metrics, alerting systems, visualization.

15. **Design an online payment system (like Stripe)**  
   - Covers: Security, distributed transactions, handling failures, external API integrations.

### Bonus Practice:
1. **Design a distributed database**  
   - Covers: Sharding, replication, consistency models, consensus algorithms.

2. **Design an API rate limiter**  
   - Covers: Traffic management, rate limiting algorithms, API gateway design.

### Preparation Tips:
- **Practice trade-offs**: For each design, consider trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP theorem).
- **Learn to ask clarifying questions**: Don't rush into designing. Start by asking about requirements and constraints.
- **Review system design patterns**: Learn common design patterns like microservices, event-driven architectures, and message-passing systems.
- **Mock Interviews**: Spend time simulating 3-5 mock interviews to refine your ability to communicate and defend your design decisions.

With 1 month of focused prep, you should have a well-rounded grasp of both fundamentals and complex systems, setting you up for success in your interviews!
