### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree where each node contains an additional pointer called `next`, write a function that connects each node's `next` pointer to the node on its right. If there is no node on the right, the `next` pointer should be set to `None`. The tree is a perfect binary tree, meaning all interior nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

### Function Definition
Here's the function signature for the problem in Python:

```python
class TreeLinkNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.next = None

import collections

class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: TreeLinkNode) -> None:
        # Implementation here
```

### High-Level Approach
1. **Use Level Order Traversal**: A level order traversal using a queue is a natural fit for this problem because it processes nodes level by level.
2. **Set `next` Pointers**: For each node at a level, set its `next` pointer to the node immediately to its right. If there is no node to the right, set the `next` pointer to `None`.
3. **Queue Management**: Add children of the current node to the queue to be processed in the subsequent levels.

### Implementation Explanation
- **Queue Initialization**: Start with the root node in the queue.
- **Level Order Traversal**: For each node, set the `next` pointer for its children and enqueue them for further processing.
- **Handling `next` Pointers**:
  - For a node's left child, set its `next` pointer to the node's right child.
  - For a node's right child, set its `next` pointer to the left child of the node's `next` node (if available), or `None`.

### Example
Hereâ€™s how you might set up a test tree and use the `connect` function:

```python
# Constructing the tree:
#       1
#      / \
#     2   3
#    / \ / \
#   4  5 6  7

root = TreeLinkNode(1)
root.left = TreeLinkNode(2)
root.right = TreeLinkNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeLinkNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeLinkNode(5)
root.right.left = TreeLinkNode(6)
root.right.right = TreeLinkNode(7)

# Connect nodes
sol = Solution()
sol.connect(root)

# Example checks
# root.left.next should be root.right (2 -> 3)
print(root.left.next.val)  # Output: 3
# root.left.left.next should be root.left.right (4 -> 5)
print(root.left.left.next.val)  # Output: 5
# root.left.right.next should be root.right.left (5 -> 6)
print(root.left.right.next.val)  # Output: 6
# root.right.left.next should be root.right.right (6 -> 7)
print(root.right.left.next.val)  # Output: 7
# root.right.right.next should be None (7 -> None)
print(root.right.right.next)  # Output: None
```

This implementation assumes that the tree is a perfect binary tree. The `connect` method processes each node, sets the `next` pointers appropriately, and ensures that all nodes at the same level are connected.
