Certainly! Here's a comprehensive overview of the **Word Search II** problem, including the problem statement, function definition, example function calls, and a high-level solution approach.

## **Problem Statement**

### **Word Search II**

Given an `m x n` grid of characters (`board`) and a list of strings (`words`), find all words from the list that can be formed by sequentially adjacent cells on the board.

- **Adjacency:** Cells are **horizontally** or **vertically** neighboring. **Diagonal** adjacency is **not** allowed.
- **Reuse of Cells:** The **same letter cell may not be used more than once** in a single word.

### **Examples**

---

#### **Example 1:**

**Input:**
```python
board = [
    ["o","a","a","n"],
    ["e","t","a","e"],
    ["i","h","k","r"],
    ["i","f","l","v"]
]
words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
```

**Output:**
```python
["eat","oath"]
```

**Explanation:**
- **"eat"** can be formed by the path `(1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2)`.
- **"oath"** can be formed by the path `(0,0) -> (0,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)`.

---

#### **Example 2:**

**Input:**
```python
board = [
    ["a","b"],
    ["c","d"]
]
words = ["abcb"]
```

**Output:**
```python
[]
```

**Explanation:**
- The word **"abcb"** cannot be constructed because the letter 'b' is used twice, violating the rule of using each cell only once.

---

#### **Example 3:**

**Input:**
```python
board = [
    ["a","a"]
]
words = ["aaa"]
```

**Output:**
```python
[]
```

**Explanation:**
- The word **"aaa"** cannot be formed as there are only two 'a's on the board.

---

## **Function Definition**

Here's the function signature you need to implement:

```python
from typing import List

def find_words(board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """
    Finds all words from the list that can be formed by sequentially adjacent cells on the board.

    Args:
        board (List[List[str]]): 2D grid of characters.
        words (List[str]): List of words to search for.

    Returns:
        List[str]: List of words found on the board.
    """
    pass  # Your implementation here
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `board`: A 2D list of characters representing the grid.
  - `words`: A list of strings representing the words to search for.

- **Returns:**
  - A list of strings representing all words found on the board.

---

## **Example Function Calls**

Here are some example calls to the `find_words` function:

```python
# Example 1
board1 = [
    ["o","a","a","n"],
    ["e","t","a","e"],
    ["i","h","k","r"],
    ["i","f","l","v"]
]
words1 = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
print(find_words(board1, words1))  # Output: ["eat","oath"]

# Example 2
board2 = [
    ["a","b"],
    ["c","d"]
]
words2 = ["abcb"]
print(find_words(board2, words2))  # Output: []

# Example 3
board3 = [
    ["a","a"]
]
words3 = ["aaa"]
print(find_words(board3, words3))  # Output: []

# Example 4
board4 = [
    ["a","b","c"],
    ["a","e","d"],
    ["a","f","g"]
]
words4 = ["abe","abc","abf","aed","afg"]
print(find_words(board4, words4))  # Output: ["abe","abc","abf","aed","afg"]
```

## **High-Level Solution**

To efficiently solve the **Word Search II** problem, we'll utilize a combination of a **Trie (Prefix Tree)** and **Backtracking**. This approach optimizes the search by enabling quick prefix checks and pruning unnecessary paths early, which is crucial given the potentially large size of the board and the list of words.

### **1. Overview of the Approach**

- **Trie Construction:** Build a Trie from the list of words to facilitate efficient prefix checking.
- **Backtracking Search:** Traverse the board using DFS (Depth-First Search) and backtrack to explore all possible paths that can form the words.
- **Pruning:** Remove branches from the Trie once a word is found to prevent redundant searches and improve performance.

### **2. Step-by-Step Solution**

#### **Step 1: Build a Trie from the List of Words**

- **Purpose:**  
  The Trie allows for efficient prefix checking, enabling the algorithm to determine quickly whether the current sequence of characters on the board can potentially form any of the target words.

- **Implementation:**
  - Each node in the Trie represents a character.
  - Nodes have a `children` dictionary mapping characters to child nodes.
  - A `word` attribute marks the end of a word.

#### **Step 2: Traverse the Board Using Backtracking**

- **Process:**
  - Iterate over each cell in the board.
  - For each cell, initiate a backtracking search if the character exists as a child of the Trie's root.

- **Backtracking Steps:**
  1. **Check for Word Completion:**
     - If the current Trie node marks the end of a word (`word` is not `None`), add it to the result list.
     - Set `word` to `None` to avoid duplicate entries.
  
  2. **Mark the Current Cell as Visited:**
     - Temporarily change the character in the board to a special marker (e.g., `'#'`) to indicate it's been visited in the current path.
  
  3. **Explore Adjacent Cells:**
     - Recursively explore all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that match the next character in any of the words.
  
  4. **Restore the Current Cell:**
     - After exploring, revert the cell's character to its original value to allow its use in other paths.
  
  5. **Prune the Trie:**
     - If a Trie node has no children after backtracking, remove it to optimize future searches.

#### **Step 3: Collect and Return the Results**

- After traversing the entire board and performing backtracking, compile all found words into a result list and return it.

### **3. Why Use a Trie?**

- **Efficient Prefix Checking:**
  The Trie allows the algorithm to determine whether to continue searching along a particular path, thereby pruning unnecessary searches early.

- **Space Optimization:**
  Tries efficiently store words with common prefixes, reducing redundant storage.

### **4. Time and Space Complexity**

- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(m * n * 4^L), where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the board, and `L` is the maximum length of the words. However, the Trie significantly reduces the number of unnecessary searches.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(W * L), where `W` is the number of words and `L` is the average length of the words. The Trie consumes O(W * L) space, and the recursion stack can go as deep as the length of the words.

## **Illustrative Python Implementation**

Below is a Python implementation of the **Word Search II** problem, incorporating the Trie data structure and backtracking with the optimization of pruning leaf nodes.

```python
from typing import List

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}  # Dictionary to hold child TrieNodes
        self.word = None    # When a word ends at this node

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()  # Root of the Trie

    def insert(self, word: str):
        """
        Inserts a word into the Trie.

        Args:
            word (str): The word to be inserted.
        """
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            # If the character is not already a child, add a new TrieNode
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.word = word  # Mark the end of a word

def find_words(board: List[List[str]], words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """
    Finds all words from the list that can be formed by sequentially adjacent cells on the board.

    Args:
        board (List[List[str]]): 2D grid of characters.
        words (List[str]): List of words to search for.

    Returns:
        List[str]: List of words found on the board.
    """
    # Step 1: Build the Trie from the list of words

    def backtrack(row: int, col: int, parent: TrieNode):
        """
        Performs backtracking to find words starting from the (row, col) position.

        Args:
            row (int): Current row position on the board.

        # Restore the original letter after backtracking
        board[row][col] = letter  # Restore the letter for other paths
        
        # ### Optimization: remove the leaf node
        # If the current Trie node has no children after backtracking,
        # it means no further words can be formed from this path.
        # Therefore, we remove this node from its parent to prune the Trie,
        # which reduces the search space and improves efficiency.
        if not current_node.children:
            del parent.children[letter]  # Prune the leaf node from the Trie

    # Step 2: Start backtracking from each cell in the board
    for row in range(rows):
        for col in range(cols):
            # If the current cell's letter is a starting character in the Trie, begin backtracking
            if board[row][col] in trie.root.children:
                backtrack(row, col, trie.root)

## **Detailed Explanation of the Solution**

### **1. Trie Construction**

- **Classes:**
  - `TrieNode`: Represents each node in the Trie with a `children` dictionary and a `word` attribute.
  - `Trie`: Encapsulates the root of the Trie and provides an `insert` method to add words.

- **Insertion:**
  - Each word from the `words` list is inserted into the Trie character by character.
  - The end of a word is marked by setting the `word` attribute.

### **2. Backtracking Function (`backtrack`)**

- **Parameters:**
  - `row`, `col`: Current cell coordinates on the board.
  - `parent`: The parent `TrieNode` from which the current character is derived.

- **Process:**
  1. **Retrieve the Current Letter:**
     - `letter = board[row][col]`: Fetch the current character from the board.
  
  2. **Move to the Corresponding Trie Node:**
     - `current_node = parent.children.get(letter)`: Navigate to the child node in the Trie corresponding to the current letter.
     - If `current_node` is `None`, it means the current path does not lead to any word, so the function returns early.
  
  3. **Check for Word Completion:**
     - If `current_node.word` is not `None`, it indicates that a complete word has been found.
     - The word is added to the `result` list, and `current_node.word` is set to `None` to prevent duplicate entries.
  
  4. **Mark the Current Cell as Visited:**
     - `board[row][col] = '#'`: Temporarily mark the cell to indicate it has been visited in the current path.
  
  5. **Explore All Adjacent Cells:**
     - Iterate through all four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.
     - For each direction, calculate the new cell's coordinates.
     - If the new cell is within bounds and its character exists as a child in the current Trie node, recursively call `backtrack` on that cell.
  
  6. **Restore the Original Letter:**
     - After exploring all possible paths from the current cell, restore its original character to allow its use in other paths.
  
  7. **Optimization: Prune the Trie**
     - **Purpose:**  
       Once a word is found and all possible paths from its end have been explored, the corresponding branch in the Trie becomes unnecessary.
     - **Implementation:**  
       - `if not current_node.children:`  
         Checks if the current Trie node has any children. If it doesn't, it means no further words can be formed from this path.
       - `del parent.children[letter]`:  
         Removes the current node from its parent's `children` dictionary, effectively pruning the branch from the Trie.
     - **Benefit:**  
       This pruning reduces the search space and enhances the algorithm's efficiency by preventing unnecessary future explorations.

### **3. Main Function Logic (`find_words`)**

- **Trie Initialization:**
  - The Trie is built using the provided `words` list by inserting each word into it.
  
- **Board Traversal:**
  - Iterate over each cell in the board.
  - If the cell's character exists as a starting character in the Trie, initiate backtracking from that cell.
  
- **Result Compilation:**
  - After completing the traversal and backtracking, the `result` list contains all found words, which is then returned.

### **4. Example Walkthrough**

Consider the following example to illustrate the algorithm's execution:

#### **Given:**
```python
board = [
    ["o","a","a","n"],
    ["e","t","a","e"],
    ["i","h","k","r"],
    ["i","f","l","v"]
]
words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
```

#### **Process:**

1. **Trie Construction:**
   - Insert "oath":
     ```
     root
      └─ o
          └─ a
              └─ t
                  └─ h (word: "oath")
     ```
   - Insert "pea":
     ```
     root
      ├─ o
      │   └─ a
      │       └─ t
      │           └─ h (word: "oath")
      └─ p
          └─ e
              └─ a (word: "pea")
     ```
   - Insert "eat":
     ```
     root
      ├─ o
      │   └─ a
      │       └─ t
      │           └─ h (word: "oath")
      ├─ p
      │   └─ e
      │       └─ a (word: "pea")
      └─ e
          └─ a
              └─ t (word: "eat")
     ```
   - Insert "rain":
     ```
     root
      ├─ o
      │   └─ a
      │       └─ t
      │           └─ h (word: "oath")
      ├─ p
      │   └─ e
      │       └─ a (word: "pea")
      ├─ e
      │   └─ a
      │       └─ t (word: "eat")
      └─ r
          └─ a
              └─ i
                  └─ n (word: "rain")
     ```

2. **Backtracking and Pruning:**
   - **Finding "eat":**
     - Traverse `e -> a -> t`.
     - Add "eat" to `result`.
     - Prune the `t` node since it has no children.
  
   - **Finding "oath":**
     - Traverse `o -> a -> t -> h`.
     - Add "oath" to `result`.
     - Prune the `h` node since it has no children.
  
   - **"pea" and "rain":**
     - These words are not present on the board following the adjacency rules, so they are not added to the `result`.
  
3. **Final Result:**
   ```python
   ["eat","oath"]
   ```

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **Trie Usage:**
   - The Trie efficiently manages and searches for prefixes, enabling the algorithm to prune paths that do not lead to any word in the list.

2. **Backtracking:**
   - Systematically explores all possible paths on the board while ensuring that each cell is used only once per word.

3. **Optimization through Pruning:**
   - Removing leaf nodes from the Trie after finding a word prevents redundant searches, significantly enhancing performance.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - Combining Trie with backtracking ensures that the algorithm operates efficiently, even with large boards and extensive word lists.
