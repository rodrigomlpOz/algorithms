## Problem Statement

Given an N x N board, a knight is placed on the first block of an empty board. The knight must visit each square exactly once following the rules of chess (L-shaped moves). The goal is to print the order in which the knight visits each square.

## Function Signature

```python
def knight(N):
    pass
```

### Input Parameters

- `N`: An integer representing the size of the chessboard (N x N).

### Output

- A 2D list where each element represents the order in which the knight visits that cell. The order starts at 0.

### Example Inputs and Outputs

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** `N = 8`
- **Output:**
  ```
  [[0,  59,  38,  33,  30,  17,   8,  63],
   [37,  34,  31,  60,   9,  62,  29,  16],
   [58,   1,  36,  39,  32,  27,  18,   7],
   [35,  48,  41,  26,  61,  10,  15,  28],
   [42,  57,   2,  49,  40,  23,   6,  19],
   [47,  50,  45,  54,  25,  20,  11,  14],
   [56,  43,  52,   3,  22,  13,  24,   5],
   [51,  46,  55,  44,  53,   4,  21,  12]]
  ```

## High-Level Approach

1. **Initialize the Board**: Create an N x N board initialized with -1, indicating that the cell has not been visited.

2. **Define Moves**: The knight moves in an L-shape, which translates into the following potential moves:
   - (-1, -2), (-2, -1), (1, -2), (2, -1)
   - (-1, 2), (-2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)

3. **Backtracking**:
   - **Base Case**: If the current position count is equal to N\*N, all cells have been visited, and the solution is found.
   - **Recursive Case**: For each possible move, check if the move is safe (within bounds and to an unvisited cell). If safe, move the knight, mark the cell with the current move number, and recursively continue. If a move results in a solution, return `True`. Otherwise, backtrack by unmarking the cell and trying the next move.

4. **Check Safety**: Ensure the knight stays within bounds and does not revisit any cells.

### Function Implementation (without the actual code)

The function `knight` initializes the chessboard and calls a recursive function `backtrack` to explore all possible paths the knight can take. The `is_safe` function checks whether a move is valid. If a complete tour is found, the function outputs the board; otherwise, it reports failure to find a solution. 

The problem is computationally intensive, especially as N increases, due to the exponential number of possible moves and paths. However, with proper backtracking and pruning strategies, it can be solved for small board sizes.
