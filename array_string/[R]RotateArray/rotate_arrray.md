## **Rotate Array Problem**

### **Problem Description**

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is a non-negative integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 step to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 10^5`

### **Function Definition**

Below is the function signature in Python. You can implement this function in other programming languages as needed.

```python
def rotate(nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
    """
    Rotates the array 'nums' to the right by 'k' steps.

    Args:
    nums (List[int]): The list of integers to rotate.
    k (int): The number of steps to rotate the array.

    Returns:
    None: The function modifies the list in-place.
    """
```

### **Example Function Calls**

Here are some example calls to the `rotate` function along with expected outcomes.

```python
# Example 1
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k1 = 3
rotate(nums1, k1)
print(nums1)  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Example 2
nums2 = [-1, -100, 3, 99]
k2 = 2
rotate(nums2, k2)
print(nums2)  # Output: [3, 99, -1, -100]

# Example 3
nums3 = [1]
k3 = 0
rotate(nums3, k3)
print(nums3)  # Output: [1]
```

### **High-Level Solution**

Rotating an array can be achieved through several approaches. Below is a high-level explanation of an efficient in-place solution with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity using the **reverse** method.

#### **Reverse Method Steps:**

1. **Normalize `k`:**
   - Since rotating the array by its length `n` results in the same array, we first take `k = k % n` to handle cases where `k` is greater than `n`.

2. **Reverse the Entire Array:**
   - Reverse all elements in the array. For example, `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` becomes `[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]`.

3. **Reverse the First `k` Elements:**
   - Reverse the first `k` elements to move them to their correct rotated position. Continuing the example with `k=3`, reversing the first three elements `[7,6,5]` results in `[5,6,7,4,3,2,1]`.

4. **Reverse the Remaining `n - k` Elements:**
   - Finally, reverse the remaining elements to complete the rotation. Reversing `[4,3,2,1]` yields `[1,2,3,4]`, resulting in the final rotated array `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`.

#### **Why This Works:**

- Reversing the entire array puts the elements that need to be rotated (`k` elements) at the beginning but in reverse order.
- Reversing the first `k` elements restores their correct order.
- Reversing the remaining `n - k` elements also restores their correct order, completing the rotation.

#### **Visualization:**

Let's visualize the steps with `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` and `k = 3`:

1. **Original Array:**
   ```
   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   ```

2. **After Reversing Entire Array:**
   ```
   [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
   ```

3. **After Reversing First 3 Elements (`k=3`):**
   ```
   [5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]
   ```

4. **After Reversing Remaining 4 Elements (`n-k=4`):**
   ```
   [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
   ```

#### **Advantages of the Reverse Method:**

- **Efficiency:** Runs in linear time with respect to the number of elements.
- **Space:** Requires only a constant amount of extra space.
- **In-Place:** Modifies the input array without the need for additional arrays.

## **Alternative Approaches**

While the reverse method is highly efficient, here are other common approaches to solving the Rotate Array problem:

1. **Using Extra Space:**
   - Create a new array of the same size.
   - Place each element of the original array into its rotated position in the new array.
   - Copy the new array back to the original array.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n)

2. **Cyclic Replacements:**
   - Move elements to their correct positions one by one, keeping track of the number of elements moved.
   - Handle cases where the number of rotations doesn't cover all elements by using a loop.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)

3. **Using Python's List Slicing:**
   - Utilize Python's powerful slicing capabilities to perform rotations in a concise manner.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     def rotate(nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
         n = len(nums)
         k %= n
         nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]
     ```
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the creation of new lists via slicing.

Each approach has its own trade-offs in terms of readability, space usage, and in-place modification. The reverse method is generally preferred for its in-place operation and constant space usage.
