Understood! Here's a concise breakdown of **LeetCode Problem 14: "Longest Common Prefix"** using the **Horizontal Scanning Approach** in Python.

---

## **Problem Definition**

**Objective:**  
Find the longest common prefix string among an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

**Examples:**

1. **Input:** `["flower","flow","flight"]`  
   **Output:** `"fl"`

2. **Input:** `["dog","racecar","car"]`  
   **Output:** `""`

---

## **Function Definition**

```python
def longestCommonPrefix(strs: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Finds the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

    Parameters:
    strs (List[str]): The list of strings to examine.

    Returns:
    str: The longest common prefix, or an empty string if there is none.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
```

---

## **Function Calls**

```python
# Example 1
result1 = longestCommonPrefix(["flower","flow","flight"])
print(result1)  # Output: "fl"

# Example 2
result2 = longestCommonPrefix(["dog","racecar","car"])
print(result2)  # Output: ""

# Additional Example
result3 = longestCommonPrefix(["interstellar", "internet", "internal"])
print(result3)  # Output: "inte"
```

## **High-Level Solution: Horizontal Scanning Approach**

**Idea:**  
Start by assuming the first string is the common prefix. Iteratively compare this prefix with each subsequent string, trimming the prefix from the end until it matches the start of the current string. If at any point the prefix becomes empty, return `""`.

**Steps:**

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the list is empty, return `""`.
   - If there's only one string, return that string.

2. **Initialize Prefix:**
   - Set the prefix to the first string in the list.

3. **Iterative Comparison:**
   - For each string in the list:
     - While the current string does not start with the prefix:
       - Remove the last character from the prefix.
       - If the prefix becomes empty, return `""`.

4. **Return Result:**
   - After all comparisons, return the final prefix.

**Time Complexity:**  
O(n * m) where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the length of the shortest string.

**Space Complexity:**  
O(1) since no additional space proportional to input size is used.

## **Python Implementation**

```python
from typing import List

def longestCommonPrefix(strs: List[str]) -> str:
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    # Initialize the prefix with the first string
    prefix = strs[0]
    
    for string in strs[1:]:
        # Shorten the prefix until it matches the start of the current string
        while not string.startswith(prefix):
            prefix = prefix[:-1]
            if not prefix:
                return ""
    
    return prefix
```

---

## **Brief Explanation**

1. **Initialization:**  
   The first string is taken as the initial prefix.

2. **Comparison:**  
   For each subsequent string, check if it starts with the current prefix.
   
3. **Trimming:**  
   If it doesn't, remove the last character from the prefix and check again. Repeat until a match is found or the prefix becomes empty.

4. **Result:**  
   The final value of `prefix` after all comparisons is the longest common prefix.
