### **Problem Definition**

**Zigzag Conversion**

The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this:

```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```

After writing the string in this zigzag pattern, you read the pattern row by row to get the converted string: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`.

**Task:**  
Write a function that takes a string `s` and an integer `numRows`, and returns the string formed by reading the zigzag pattern row by row.

### **Function Signature**

```python
def convert(s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
    pass
```

---

### **Example Function Calls**

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```

**Example 2:**

```python
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
```

**Example 3:**

```python
Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"
```

### **High-Level Approach**

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `numRows` is `1` or greater than or equal to the length of the string `s`, the zigzag pattern is identical to the original string. Return `s` as is.

2. **Initialize Data Structures:**
   - Create a list of strings, where each string represents a row in the zigzag pattern.

3. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - Use a variable to keep track of the current row.
   - Use a direction flag to determine whether to move down or up the rows.
   - Append each character to the appropriate row based on the current direction.

4. **Change Direction:**
   - When the topmost or bottommost row is reached, change the direction of traversal.

5. **Concatenate Rows:**
   - After populating all rows, concatenate them to form the final converted string.

### **Explanation of the Approach**

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `numRows` is `1` or the number of rows is greater than or equal to the length of the string, there's no zigzag conversion needed. The original string is returned as is.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A list `rows` is created to store strings for each row of the zigzag pattern. The size of this list is the minimum between `numRows` and the length of the string `s` to handle cases where the string is shorter than the number of rows.

3. **Traversal:**
   - `current_row` keeps track of the current row to which the character should be appended.
   - `going_down` is a boolean flag indicating the direction of traversal. It starts as `False` and toggles when the top or bottom row is reached.
   - For each character in the string:
     - Append the character to the `current_row`.
     - If the `current_row` is at the top (`0`) or bottom (`numRows - 1`), toggle the `going_down` flag to change direction.
     - Move `current_row` up or down based on the `going_down` flag.

4. **Concatenation:**
   - After populating all rows, iterate through the `rows` list and concatenate each row to form the final converted string.

### **Time and Space Complexity**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. The algorithm traverses the string once.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), as additional space is used to store the characters in the `rows` list.

---

### **Conclusion**

This approach efficiently converts a given string into its zigzag form by simulating the traversal of rows and managing the direction of movement. By appending characters to the appropriate rows and then concatenating these rows, the final converted string is obtained with optimal time and space complexity.
