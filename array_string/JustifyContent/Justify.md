## **Text Justification Comprehensive Guide**

### **1. Problem Description**

#### **Text Justification**

Given an array of words and a maximum width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (both left and right) justified.

**Requirements:**

- **Greedy Approach**: Pack as many words as possible in each line without exceeding `maxWidth`.
- **Space Distribution**:
  - Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible.
  - If the number of spaces doesn't divide evenly, the left slots will receive more spaces than the right slots.
- **Last Line**: Should be left-justified, meaning words are separated by a single space, and any remaining spaces are added at the end.
- **Word Constraints**:
  - Each word consists of non-space characters only.
  - Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed `maxWidth`.
  - The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Examples:**

- **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input:
    words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
    maxWidth = 16

    Output:
    [
        "This    is    an",
        "example  of text",
        "justification.  "
    ]
    ```

- **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input:
    words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
    maxWidth = 16

    Output:
    [
        "What   must   be",
        "acknowledgment  ",
        "shall be        "
    ]
    ```

- **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input:
    words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
             "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
    maxWidth = 20

    Output:
    [
        "Science  is  what we",
        "understand      well",
        "enough to explain to",
        "a computer.  Art is",
        "everything else we do"
    ]
    ```

---

### **2. Function Definition**

We'll define a function `fullJustify` that takes in a list of strings `words` and an integer `maxWidth`, and returns a list of strings representing the fully justified text.

```python
from typing import List

def fullJustify(words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:
    pass  # Implementation goes here
```

---

### **3. Function Implementation**

Below is the complete Python implementation of the `fullJustify` function based on the high-level solution.

```python
from typing import List

def fullJustify(words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:
    result = []             # To store the final justified text
    current_line = []       # To store words for the current line
    num_of_letters = 0      # Total number of letters in current_line

    for word in words:
        # Check if adding the new word exceeds the maxWidth
        if num_of_letters + len(word) + len(current_line) > maxWidth:
            if len(current_line) == 1:
                # If there's only one word in the line, left-justify it
                line = current_line[0] + ' ' * (maxWidth - num_of_letters)
            else:
                # Calculate the total number of spaces to distribute
                total_spaces = maxWidth - num_of_letters
                space_between_words, extra_spaces = divmod(total_spaces, len(current_line) - 1)
                
                line = ''
                for i in range(len(current_line) - 1):
                    # Assign an extra space to the left slots
                    spaces_to_add = space_between_words + (1 if i < extra_spaces else 0)
                    line += current_line[i] + ' ' * spaces_to_add
                line += current_line[-1]  # Add the last word without extra spaces
            result.append(line)
            # Reset for the next line
            current_line = []
            num_of_letters = 0
        # Add the current word to the line
        current_line.append(word)
        num_of_letters += len(word)
    
    # Handle the last line: left-justified
    last_line = ' '.join(current_line)
    spaces_to_add = maxWidth - len(last_line)
    last_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
    result.append(last_line)
    
    return result
```

### **4. Function Calls**

Let's see how to use the `fullJustify` function with the provided examples. Instead of using `assert` statements, we'll use `print` statements to display the results.

```python
def test_fullJustify():
    # Example 1
    words1 = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
    maxWidth1 = 16
    output1 = fullJustify(words1, maxWidth1)
    expected1 = [
        "This    is    an",
        "example  of text",
        "justification.  "
    ]
    print("Test 1 Output:")
    for line in output1:
        print(f'"{line}"')
    print("Expected:")
    for line in expected1:
        print(f'"{line}"')
    print("-" * 30)
    
    # Example 2
    words2 = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
    maxWidth2 = 16
    output2 = fullJustify(words2, maxWidth2)
    expected2 = [
        "What   must   be",
        "acknowledgment  ",
        "shall be        "
    ]
    print("Test 2 Output:")
    for line in output2:
        print(f'"{line}"')
    print("Expected:")
    for line in expected2:
        print(f'"{line}"')
    print("-" * 30)
    
    # Example 3
    words3 = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
              "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
    maxWidth3 = 20
    output3 = fullJustify(words3, maxWidth3)
    expected3 = [
        "Science  is  what we",
        "understand      well",
        "enough to explain to",
        "a computer.  Art is",
        "everything else we do"
    ]
    print("Test 3 Output:")
    for line in output3:
        print(f'"{line}"')
    print("Expected:")
    for line in expected3:
        print(f'"{line}"')
    print("-" * 30)

# Run the tests
test_fullJustify()
```

**Output:**
```
Test 1 Output:
"This    is    an"
"example  of text"
"justification.  "
Expected:
"This    is    an"
"example  of text"
"justification.  "
------------------------------
Test 2 Output:
"What   must   be"
"acknowledgment  "
"shall be        "
Expected:
"What   must   be"
"acknowledgment  "
"shall be        "
------------------------------
Test 3 Output:
"Science  is  what we"
"understand      well"
"enough to explain to"
"a computer.  Art is"
"everything else we do"
Expected:
"Science  is  what we"
"understand      well"
"enough to explain to"
"a computer.  Art is"
"everything else we do"
------------------------------
```

### **5. Detailed Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

Let's dissect how the `fullJustify` function processes the input to produce the desired output using **Example 1**.

#### **Recap of Example 1**

**Input:**
```python
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[
    "This    is    an",
    "example  of text",
    "justification.  "
]
```

#### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

We'll go through the `fullJustify` function step by step with the given input.

##### **1. Function Initialization**

```python
def fullJustify(words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:
    result = []             # To store the final justified text
    current_line = []       # To store words for the current line
    num_of_letters = 0      # Total number of letters in current_line
```

- **`result`**: An empty list to hold all the justified lines.
- **`current_line`**: An empty list to collect words for the current line being processed.
- **`num_of_letters`**: A counter to keep track of the total number of letters (excluding spaces) in `current_line`.

##### **2. Iterating Through Each Word**

The function iterates through each word in the `words` list to build and justify lines.

```python
for word in words:
    # Check if adding the new word exceeds the maxWidth
    if num_of_letters + len(word) + len(current_line) > maxWidth:
        ...
    # Add the current word to the line
    current_line.append(word)
    num_of_letters += len(word)
```

- **Condition Explanation**:
    - `num_of_letters`: Total letters in `current_line`.
    - `len(word)`: Length of the new word to be added.
    - `len(current_line)`: Number of existing words, which equates to the number of spaces needed between them.
    - If the sum exceeds `maxWidth`, the current line is ready to be justified.

##### **3. Justifying the Current Line**

When the condition is met, the current line needs to be justified before moving on to the next line.

```python
if len(current_line) == 1:
    # If there's only one word in the line, left-justify it
    line = current_line[0] + ' ' * (maxWidth - num_of_letters)
else:
    # Calculate the total number of spaces to distribute
    total_spaces = maxWidth - num_of_letters
    space_between_words, extra_spaces = divmod(total_spaces, len(current_line) - 1)
    
    line = ''
    for i in range(len(current_line) - 1):
        # Assign an extra space to the left slots
        spaces_to_add = space_between_words + (1 if i < extra_spaces else 0)
        line += current_line[i] + ' ' * spaces_to_add
    line += current_line[-1]  # Add the last word without extra spaces
result.append(line)
# Reset for the next line
current_line = []
num_of_letters = 0
```

- **Single Word in Line**:
    - If there's only one word, it's left-justified by appending spaces to reach `maxWidth`.
  
- **Multiple Words in Line**:
    - **`total_spaces`**: Total spaces to distribute (`maxWidth` minus the total letters).
    - **`space_between_words`**: Minimum spaces between each pair of words.
    - **`extra_spaces`**: Remaining spaces to distribute, starting from the left.
    - The loop adds each word followed by the calculated number of spaces.
    - The last word is appended without additional spaces.

- **Resetting for Next Line**:
    - After justifying, `current_line` and `num_of_letters` are reset for the next line.

##### **4. Handling the Last Line**

After processing all words, the last line is handled separately to ensure it's left-justified.

```python
# Handle the last line: left-justified
last_line = ' '.join(current_line)
spaces_to_add = maxWidth - len(last_line)
last_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
result.append(last_line)
```

- **Joining Words**: Words are joined with a single space.
- **Padding Spaces**: Remaining spaces are added at the end to meet `maxWidth`.
- **Appending to Result**: The last line is added to `result`.

##### **5. Returning the Result**

Finally, the fully justified text is returned.

```python
return result
```

**Final Output:**
```
[
    "This    is    an",
    "example  of text",
    "justification.  "
]
```

#### **Detailed Walkthrough with Example 1**

Let's process **Example 1** step by step.

**Input:**
```python
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16
```

**Initialization:**

- `result = []`
- `current_line = []`
- `num_of_letters = 0`

**Processing Each Word:**

| Step | Word             | Action                                  | `current_line`            | `num_of_letters` | `result`                  |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 1    | "This"           | Add to current line                     | ["This"]                  | 4                 | []                        |
| 2    | "is"             | Add to current line                     | ["This", "is"]            | 6                 | []                        |
| 3    | "an"             | Add to current line                     | ["This", "is", "an"]      | 8                 | []                        |
| 4    | "example"        | Justify `["This", "is", "an"]`          | ["example"]               | 7                 | ["This    is    an"]      |
| 5    | "of"             | Add to current line                     | ["example", "of"]         | 9                 | ["This    is    an"]      |
| 6    | "text"           | Add to current line                     | ["example", "of", "text"] | 13                | ["This    is    an"]      |
| 7    | "justification." | Justify `["example", "of", "text"]`     | ["justification."]        | 14                | ["This    is    an", "example  of text"] |
| -    | End of words     | Justify `["justification."]` (last line)| []                        | 0                 | ["This    is    an", "example  of text", "justification.  "] |

**Justification Details:**

1. **First Line (`["This", "is", "an"]`):**
    - **Total Letters**: 4 + 2 + 2 = 8
    - **Total Spaces**: 16 - 8 = 8
    - **Gaps**: 2
    - **Space Distribution**:
        - `space_between_words = 8 // 2 = 4`
        - `extra_spaces = 8 % 2 = 0`
    - **Line**: "This" + 4 spaces + "is" + 4 spaces + "an" = `"This    is    an"`

2. **Second Line (`["example", "of", "text"]`):**
    - **Total Letters**: 7 + 2 + 4 = 13
    - **Total Spaces**: 16 - 13 = 3
    - **Gaps**: 2
    - **Space Distribution**:
        - `space_between_words = 3 // 2 = 1`
        - `extra_spaces = 3 % 2 = 1`
    - **Line**:
        - First gap: 1 + 1 = 2 spaces
        - Second gap: 1 space
        - `"example" + 2 spaces + "of" + 1 space + "text" = "example  of text"`

3. **Last Line (`["justification."]`):**
    - **Total Letters**: 14
    - **Total Spaces**: 16 - 14 = 2
    - **Line**: "justification." + 2 spaces = `"justification.  "`

**Final Result:**
```
[
    "This    is    an",
    "example  of text",
    "justification.  "
]
```

### **6. Key Takeaways**

1. **Greedy Approach**: The function employs a greedy strategy, packing as many words as possible into each line without exceeding `maxWidth`.

2. **Space Distribution**:
    - **Even Distribution**: Spaces are distributed as evenly as possible between words.
    - **Extra Spaces**: If spaces don't divide evenly, extra spaces are added to the leftmost gaps.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
    - **Single Word Lines**: If a line contains only one word, it's left-justified with spaces appended at the end.
    - **Last Line**: The last line is always left-justified, regardless of space distribution.

4. **Efficiency**:
    - **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of words. Each word is processed exactly once.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(N), for storing the result and temporary variables.

### **7. Additional Example for Clarity**

Let's consider another example to reinforce understanding.

**Input:**
```python
words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
maxWidth = 16
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[
    "What   must   be",
    "acknowledgment  ",
    "shall be        "
]
```

**Processing Steps:**

1. **First Line:**
    - **Words**: ["What", "must", "be"]
    - **Total Letters**: 4 + 4 + 2 = 10
    - **Spaces to Distribute**: 16 - 10 = 6
    - **Gaps**: 2
    - **Space Distribution**:
        - `space_between_words = 6 // 2 = 3`
        - `extra_spaces = 6 % 2 = 0`
    - **Line**: "What" + 3 spaces + "must" + 3 spaces + "be" = `"What   must   be"`

2. **Second Line:**
    - **Words**: ["acknowledgment"]
    - **Total Letters**: 14
    - **Spaces to Distribute**: 16 - 14 = 2
    - **Line**: "acknowledgment" + 2 spaces = `"acknowledgment  "`

3. **Third Line (Last Line):**
    - **Words**: ["shall", "be"]
    - **Total Letters**: 5 + 2 = 7
    - **Spaces to Distribute**: 16 - 7 - 1 = 8 (1 space between words)
    - **Line**: "shall" + 1 space + "be" + 8 spaces = `"shall be        "`

**Final Output:**
```
[
    "What   must   be",
    "acknowledgment  ",
    "shall be        "
]
```

---

## **Conclusion**

The `fullJustify` function effectively formats a list of words into fully justified text lines, adhering to the specified `maxWidth`. By carefully managing space distribution and handling edge cases (such as single-word lines and the last line), the implementation ensures the output meets the problem's requirements.

**Key Points:**

- **Greedy Strategy**: Maximizes the number of words per line without exceeding `maxWidth`.
- **Space Management**: Distributes spaces as evenly as possible, prioritizing left gaps for extra spaces.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Properly formats lines with single words and ensures the last line is left-justified.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized with O(N) time complexity and O(N) space complexity.
