#Case were there were duplicated similar to 3sum
The condition `j > i + 1` is necessary because you want to skip duplicates **only after the first occurrence** of the second element (i.e., the element at index `j`). Hereâ€™s why it matters:

1. **Avoid Skipping the First Valid Occurrence**: The first occurrence of a number should be considered because it's part of a unique quadruplet. If you skip the first occurrence, you might miss valid combinations. By checking `j > i + 1`, you ensure that only subsequent duplicate values are skipped, not the first one.

2. **Maintain the Integrity of Nested Loops**: The `i` index is fixed in the outer loop, and `j` starts from `i + 1`. If `j == i + 1`, this is the first time you're selecting `arr[j]` as part of a potential quadruplet, so you don't want to skip it, even if `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`. By using `j > i + 1`, you ensure that **duplicate values are only skipped after the first valid selection**.

### Example to illustrate:

Suppose `arr = [-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2]`, and you're looking for quadruplets that sum to `2`.

- When `i = 0`, `arr[i] = -1`.
- On the first iteration, `j = 1` and `arr[j] = 0`. This is a valid choice, so we continue.
- On the next iteration, `j = 2`, and `arr[j] = 0` again. Now, you don't want to reconsider this element because it's the same as `arr[j - 1]`, so you skip it to avoid repeating the same quadruplet (like `[-1, 0, 0, 2]` multiple times).
- The `j > i + 1` ensures that we skip **only the duplicate 0s after the first one**.

Without the `j > i + 1` check, you'd mistakenly skip the very first occurrence of `0`, which might be a valid part of the quadruplet.

### To summarize:
- `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`: This ensures you're not repeating the same number twice for the second element.
- `j > i + 1`: This ensures you skip duplicates **only after the first valid occurrence** of the second element `arr[j]`, preventing duplicate quadruplets while preserving all valid unique combinations.

Let me know if that clears things up!
