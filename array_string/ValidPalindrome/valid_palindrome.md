## Problem Statement

The problem "Valid Palindrome" involves determining if a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. The solution should disregard spaces and punctuation.

### Function Signature

```python
def validPalindrome(s):
    pass
```

### Input Parameters

- `s`: A string that can include letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation.

### Output

- A boolean value indicating whether the string is a valid palindrome.

### Example Inputs and Outputs

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** `s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`
- **Output:** `True`
- **Explanation:** After removing non-alphanumeric characters and ignoring case, the string becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama", which reads the same forwards and backwards.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** `s = "race a car"`
- **Output:** `False`
- **Explanation:** After removing non-alphanumeric characters and ignoring case, the string becomes "raceacar", which does not read the same forwards and backwards.

### High-Level Approach

1. **Filter Alphanumeric Characters**: Convert the input string to a list of lowercase characters, keeping only alphanumeric characters. This step ensures that spaces and punctuation are ignored.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning (`start`) and the other at the end (`end`) of the filtered list. Compare the characters at these positions. If they are not equal, the string is not a palindrome.

3. **Move Pointers**: If the characters match, move the `start` pointer forward and the `end` pointer backward, then repeat the comparison until the pointers meet or cross.

4. **Check Palindrome**: If all corresponding characters match during the comparison, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
