### Problem Statement: Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

**Problem Description:**

Implement the `RandomizedSet` class:

### Summary of Constraints:
- O(1) time complexity for `insert`, `remove`, and `getRandom`.
- No duplicate elements in the set.
- You need to use a combination of a **list** (for random access) and a **hashmap** (for tracking indices).

 ### Function Definitions:

```python
import random

class RandomizedSet:
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        pass
    
    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:
        """
        Inserts an item val into the set if not present. 
        Returns True if the item was not present, False otherwise.
        """
        pass
    
    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:
        """
        Removes an item val from the set if present.
        Returns True if the item was present, False otherwise.
        """
        pass
    
    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        """
        Returns a random element from the current set of elements. 
        Each element must have the same probability of being returned.
        """
        pass
```

### Function Calls:

```python
# Initialize the RandomizedSet object
randomizedSet = RandomizedSet()

# Example function calls
print(randomizedSet.insert(1))  # Inserts 1 to the set. Should return True as it was not present before.
print(randomizedSet.remove(2))  # Removes 2 from the set. Should return False as it is not present.
print(randomizedSet.insert(2))  # Inserts 2 to the set. Should return True as it was not present before.
print(randomizedSet.getRandom()) # Should return 1 or 2 randomly.
print(randomizedSet.remove(1))  # Removes 1 from the set. Should return True.
print(randomizedSet.insert(2))  # 2 is already in the set, so should return False.
print(randomizedSet.getRandom()) # Should return 2.
```

This structure defines the class and outlines the required methods (`insert`, `remove`, `getRandom`) without providing an implementation.

**Constraints:**

- Implement the functions such that each function works in average O(1) time complexity.

### High-Level Approach

1. **Data Structures:**
   - Use a list to store the elements. This allows for O(1) time complexity for `getRandom()` by leveraging Pythonâ€™s `random.choice`.
   - Use a dictionary to map the values to their indices in the list. This allows for O(1) time complexity for both `insert` and `remove` operations.

2. **Insert Operation:**
   - Check if the value already exists in the dictionary.
   - If it does not exist, append the value to the list and record its index in the dictionary.
   - If it exists, return `False`.

3. **Remove Operation:**
   - Check if the value exists in the dictionary.
   - If it exists, find its index in the list. Swap the element with the last element in the list.
   - Update the dictionary to reflect the new index of the swapped element.
   - Remove the last element from the list and delete the value from the dictionary.
   - If it does not exist, return `False`.

4. **Get Random Operation:**
   - Use `random.choice` to return a random element from the list.


Using a Python `set` alone doesn't allow us to achieve all the required operations (`insert`, `remove`, `getRandom`) in average O(1) time complexity. Here's why:

1. **Insert Operation (O(1))**:
   - Inserting an element into a Python `set` is generally O(1), which is efficient and works well.

2. **Remove Operation (O(1))**:
   - Removing an element from a Python `set` is also O(1), which is efficient.

3. **Get Random Operation (O(1))**:
   - This is where the challenge arises. While you can obtain a random element from a list in O(1) using `random.choice`, doing the same from a `set` is not straightforward because `set` elements are unordered and do not support direct indexing. Thus, retrieving an element randomly with equal probability is not O(1) in a `set`.

To achieve O(1) for all operations, including `getRandom()`, a combination of a list and a dictionary is used:

- **List**: Maintains the elements and supports efficient random access by index (O(1) for `getRandom()`).
- **Dictionary**: Maps each value to its index in the list, supporting O(1) time complexity for `insert` and `remove`.


### Why Not Just Use a Python Set?

- **Random Access**: Sets do not support indexing, which means you cannot directly access an element by its position. Therefore, you cannot efficiently implement `getRandom()` with uniform probability without converting the set to a list or using additional data structures.
  
- **O(1) Time Complexity for getRandom()**: Using a list allows `random.choice()` to select a random element in O(1) time. With a set, you would need to convert it to a list (O(n)) or iterate over elements, neither of which is O(1).

### Conclusion

The combination of a list and a dictionary is essential to achieve O(1) time complexity for all required operations. This structure takes advantage of the list's indexing and the dictionary's key-value mapping capabilities.
