### Problem Statement:
You need to design an algorithm to **encode** a list of strings into a single string and then **decode** the encoded string back to the original list of strings.

### Function Definitions:
```python
def encode(self, strs: list[str]) -> str:
    # Encodes a list of strings to a single string

def decode(self, s: str) -> list[str]:
    # Decodes a single string to a list of strings

# Example 1
input1 = ["neet", "code", "love", "you"]
print(f"Input: {input1}")

# Encode
encoded1 = encode(input1)
print(f"Encoded: {encoded1}")

# Decode
decoded1 = decode(encoded1)
print(f"Decoded: {decoded1}\n")

# Example 2
input2 = ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
print(f"Input: {input2}")

# Encode
encoded2 = encode(input2)
print(f"Encoded: {encoded2}")

# Decode
decoded2 = decode(encoded2)
print(f"Decoded: {decoded2}")

```
### Constraints:
- `0 <= strs.length < 100`
- `0 <= strs[i].length < 200`
- `strs[i]` contains only UTF-8 characters.

### High-Level Description:
1. **Objective**:
   - The goal is to encode a list of strings into a single string in such a way that the string can be decoded back to the original list of strings, preserving any special characters or spaces.
2. **Approach**:
   - **Encoding**: To encode, we need to mark the boundaries between the strings. A common approach is to use a delimiter and length-based encoding. For example, for each string, we can store its length followed by a special delimiter and then the string itself.
   - **Decoding**: To decode, we can reverse the process by reading the length of each string, then reading that many characters to reconstruct the original strings.
3. **Efficiency**:
   - The approach ensures that the encoded string can be split back into the original strings without ambiguity, even if the strings contain special characters or spaces.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class Solution:
    def encode(self, strs: list[str]) -> str:
        # Encode the list of strings with a length marker and a delimiter.
        encoded_string = ""
        for s in strs:
            encoded_string += str(len(s)) + "#" + s  # length + delimiter + string
        return encoded_string

    def decode(self, s: str) -> list[str]:
        # Decode the encoded string by reading the length markers.
        decoded_list = []
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            # Find the length of the next string by searching for the delimiter '#'
            j = i
            while s[j] != "#":
                j += 1
            length = int(s[i:j])  # Extract the length
            decoded_list.append(s[j + 1: j + 1 + length])  # Extract the string using the length
            i = j + 1 + length  # Move to the next encoded part
        return decoded_list
```

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
```python
strs = ["neet", "code", "love", "you"]
sol = Solution()
encoded_str = sol.encode(strs)
print(encoded_str)  # Output: "4#neet4#code4#love3#you"
decoded_list = sol.decode(encoded_str)
print(decoded_list)  # Output: ["neet", "code", "love", "you"]
```

#### Example 2:
```python
strs = ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
sol = Solution()
encoded_str = sol.encode(strs)
print(encoded_str)  # Output: "2#we3#say1#:3#yes"
decoded_list = sol.decode(encoded_str)
print(decoded_list)  # Output: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Encoding**:
   - For each string, the length of the string is computed and stored followed by a delimiter `#` and the actual string. This ensures that even strings containing special characters or spaces can be handled safely.
2. **Decoding**:
   - To decode, the algorithm scans the string for the delimiter `#` to determine the length of the next string and then extracts the string using the length information.

This approach guarantees that the encoded string can be correctly decoded back into the original list of strings without ambiguity.
