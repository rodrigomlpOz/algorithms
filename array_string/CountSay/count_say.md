### Count and Say Problem

#### Problem Statement
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of integers with the first five terms as follows:
1. 1
2. 11
3. 21
4. 1211
5. 111221

The first term is "1". Each subsequent term is generated by describing the previous term. An integer is described as a sequence of digits, reading from left to right, and each digit is described by counting the number of times it appears consecutively.

Given an integer `n`, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

#### Examples
- Input: `n = 1`
  - Output: `"1"`
- Input: `n = 4`
  - Output: `"1211"`

#### Function Signature
```python
def countAndSay(n: int) -> str:
  pass

# Example 1: Generate the 5th term
n = 5
print(f"Calling count_and_say({n})")
result = count_and_say(n)
print(f"Result of count_and_say({n}): {result}\n")

# Example 2: Generate the next term from "1211"
current_term = "1211"
print(f"Calling generate_next('{current_term}')")
next_term = generate_next(current_term)
print(f"Result of generate_next('{current_term}'): {next_term}\n")

# Example 3: Generate the 1st term
n = 1
print(f"Calling count_and_say({n})")
result = count_and_say(n)
print(f"Result of count_and_say({n}): {result}\n")

# Example 4: Generate the next term from "111221"
current_term = "111221"
print(f"Calling generate_next('{current_term}')")
next_term = generate_next(current_term)
print(f"Result of generate_next('{current_term}'): {next_term}\n")

# Example 5: Generate the 6th term
n = 6
print(f"Calling count_and_say({n})")
result = count_and_say(n)
print(f"Result of count_and_say({n}): {result}\n")
```

#### High-Level Algorithm
1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, return "1".
2. **Initialize**: Start with the first term "1".
3. **Iterate**: For each subsequent term until `n`, do the following:
    - Initialize an empty string `current` to build the next term.
    - Initialize a counter `count` to keep track of the consecutive occurrences of each digit.
    - Traverse the `previous` term:
        - If the current digit is the same as the previous one, increment the counter.
        - If the current digit is different, append the count and the previous digit to `current`, then reset the counter.
    - Append the count and the last digit to `current` after the loop.
    - Update `previous` to `current`.
4. **Return**: The final value of `previous` is the nth term of the sequence.
