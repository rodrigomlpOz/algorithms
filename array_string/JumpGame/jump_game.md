### Problem Statement (Jump Game):

You are given an array `nums` where each element represents the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from that index. Your goal is to determine if you can reach the last index starting from the first index.

- **Input**: 
  - `nums`: A list of non-negative integers, where each integer represents the maximum jump length from that position.
- **Output**:
  - Return `True` if you can reach the last index, otherwise return `False`.

### Function Definition:

```python
def canJump(nums: list[int]) -> bool:
    pass
```

### Function Calls:

```python
print(canJump([2, 3, 1, 1, 4]))  # Expected Output: True
print(canJump([3, 2, 1, 0, 4]))  # Expected Output: False
```

### High-Level Solution:

1. **Objective**: Start from the first index and figure out if it’s possible to reach the last index by jumping within the limits specified by each index’s value.
  
2. **Track Maximum Reach**: 
   - As you move through the list, keep track of the **furthest index** you can jump to.
   - If at any point your current index exceeds the furthest index you can reach, it means you are stuck, and thus you cannot reach the last index.
  
3. **Greedy Approach**: 
   - Iterate over the list and update the maximum index you can jump to.
   - If at any point the maximum reachable index is greater than or equal to the last index, return `True`.
  
4. **Edge Case**: 
   - If the list has only one element (`[0]`), the output should be `True` because you're already at the last index.
  
5. **Return**:
   - After iterating through the list, return `True` if you can reach the last index, otherwise return `False`.

### Example Walkthrough:

**Example 1**:
```python
nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
```

- **Step 1**: Start at index 0 with `nums[0] = 2`. You can jump up to 2 steps forward, meaning you can potentially reach index 2.
- **Step 2**: Move to index 1 with `nums[1] = 3`. From here, you can jump up to 3 steps, allowing you to potentially reach index 4 (the last index).
- **Step 3**: Since you can reach the last index, return `True`.

**Example 2**:
```python
nums = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]
```

- **Step 1**: Start at index 0 with `nums[0] = 3`. You can jump up to 3 steps forward, so you can potentially reach index 3.
- **Step 2**: Move to index 1 with `nums[1] = 2`. From here, you can only jump up to index 3.
- **Step 3**: Move to index 2 with `nums[2] = 1`. You can still only reach up to index 3.
- **Step 4**: Move to index 3 with `nums[3] = 0`. You can't jump anywhere from here (since the jump value is 0), and index 4 is out of reach.
- **Result**: You are stuck at index 3 and can't reach the last index, so return `False`.

Let's walk through the **greedy solution** for **Jump Game I** using an example step-by-step.

### Problem Recap:
Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, each element represents the maximum number of steps you can jump forward from that position. Your goal is to determine if you can reach the last index starting from the first index.

### Example:

```python
nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
```

The goal is to determine whether you can reach the last index (index 4) starting from index 0.

### Greedy Algorithm Walkthrough:

**Initial Setup:**
- Start by initializing `max_reach = 0`. This variable keeps track of the farthest index you can jump to.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough:

1. **Index 0**:
   - Current `max_reach = 0`.
   - You are at `i = 0`, and the value at `nums[0]` is `2`. This means you can jump up to **2 steps** forward from index 0.
   - Calculate how far you can jump from this index: `i + nums[i] = 0 + 2 = 2`.
   - Update `max_reach` to be the maximum of its current value (`0`) and this new value (`2`). Therefore, `max_reach = max(0, 2) = 2`.
   - So far, you can jump to any index from 0 to 2.

2. **Index 1**:
   - Current `max_reach = 2`.
   - You are at `i = 1`, and the value at `nums[1]` is `3`. This means you can jump up to **3 steps** forward from index 1.
   - Calculate how far you can jump from this index: `i + nums[i] = 1 + 3 = 4`.
   - Update `max_reach`: `max_reach = max(2, 4) = 4`.
   - Now, `max_reach = 4`, which is the last index. Since `max_reach` is greater than or equal to the last index, you can stop here and return `True`.

At this point, the algorithm has determined that it's possible to reach the last index, so the output is `True`.

### Summary of the Process:
- **Step 1**: From index 0, you can jump to index 2.
- **Step 2**: From index 1, you can jump to index 4 (which is the last index). Therefore, you can reach the last index.

Since `max_reach` has reached or exceeded the last index, the algorithm terminates early and returns `True`.

### Another Example: Failure Case

Now, let's consider an example where it's not possible to reach the last index:

```python
nums = [3, 2, 1, 0, 4]
```

In this case, we'll go step-by-step to see why the output is `False`.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough:

1. **Index 0**:
   - Current `max_reach = 0`.
   - You are at `i = 0`, and the value at `nums[0]` is `3`. This means you can jump up to **3 steps** forward from index 0.
   - Calculate how far you can jump: `i + nums[i] = 0 + 3 = 3`.
   - Update `max_reach = max(0, 3) = 3`.
   - So far, you can reach any index from 0 to 3.

2. **Index 1**:
   - Current `max_reach = 3`.
   - You are at `i = 1`, and the value at `nums[1]` is `2`. This means you can jump up to **2 steps** forward from index 1.
   - Calculate how far you can jump: `i + nums[i] = 1 + 2 = 3`.
   - Update `max_reach = max(3, 3) = 3`.
   - No improvement, `max_reach` remains 3.

3. **Index 2**:
   - Current `max_reach = 3`.
   - You are at `i = 2`, and the value at `nums[2]` is `1`. This means you can jump up to **1 step** forward from index 2.
   - Calculate how far you can jump: `i + nums[i] = 2 + 1 = 3`.
   - Update `max_reach = max(3, 3) = 3`.
   - Again, no improvement, `max_reach` remains 3.

4. **Index 3**:
   - Current `max_reach = 3`.
   - You are at `i = 3`, and the value at `nums[3]` is `0`. This means you **cannot jump any further** from index 3.
   - Calculate how far you can jump: `i + nums[i] = 3 + 0 = 3`.
   - Update `max_reach = max(3, 3) = 3`.
   - No improvement, `max_reach` remains 3.

5. **Index 4**:
   - Current `max_reach = 3`.
   - You are at `i = 4`, but `i = 4` is beyond `max_reach`, which is 3. This means that index 4 is not reachable.
   - Since the current index exceeds `max_reach`, return `False`.

### Summary of the Process:
- **Step 1**: From index 0, you can jump to index 3.
- **Step 2**: From index 1 and 2, you don't get any further than index 3.
- **Step 3**: At index 3, you can't move forward because `nums[3] = 0`.
- **Step 4**: Since you can't reach index 4, the algorithm returns `False`.

### Why the Greedy Approach Works:

- The greedy approach works because at each index, you make the optimal local decision: "What is the farthest I can jump from this index?" 
- You always try to maximize the reachability (`max_reach`) at each step. If, at any point, `max_reach` is greater than or equal to the last index, you can guarantee that it's possible to reach the end.
- If at any index, `max_reach` is less than the current index, it means you are stuck, and the last index is unreachable, so the algorithm returns `False`.

This approach ensures that you efficiently determine whether the last index is reachable without having to explore every possible jump path, resulting in a linear time solution.
