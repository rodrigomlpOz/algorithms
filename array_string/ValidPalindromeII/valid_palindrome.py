No, this solution won't work if there are **two or more mismatches** that would require more than one character removal. The solution is designed to handle the case where **at most one character** can be removed to form a palindrome.

### Reasoning:
- The function immediately returns `False` if the two checks for removing a single character fail. Specifically, it only tries skipping either the left or the right character **once** when it encounters the first mismatch.
- If there are two or more mismatches, this solution will not be able to handle it, because it only checks for **one possible character removal**.

### Example with two mismatches:

#### Input:
`s = "abcbaa"`

1. Initially, `left = 0` and `right = 5`. The characters `s[0]` (`'a'`) and `s[5]` (`'a'`) are the same, so we move `left` to 1 and `right` to 4.
2. Now, `s[1]` (`'b'`) and `s[4]` (`'a'`) are different.
   - The function will try skipping the left character and check if the substring `"cbaa"` is a palindrome (it’s not).
   - It will then try skipping the right character and check if the substring `"bcba"` is a palindrome (it’s not).
   
Since neither check succeeds, the function will return `False`, even though **removing both the second (`b`) and the fifth (`a`) characters** would result in a palindrome (`"acbca"`). But the function can only handle **one character removal**.

### Conclusion:
This solution is only valid when you are allowed to remove at most **one character** to make the string a palindrome. If you need to handle the case where **two or more characters** can be removed, you would need a different approach or modify the current algorithm to accommodate multiple removals.
