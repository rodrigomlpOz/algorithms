Certainly! Here's a concise breakdown of **LeetCode Problem 58: "Length of Last Word"**, including the **Problem Statement**, **Function Definition**, **Function Calls**, and a **High-Level Solution** using Python.

---

## **Problem Statement**

**Objective:**  
Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the **last word** in the string. A word is defined as a maximal substring of non-space characters.

**Examples:**

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** `s = "Hello World"`
   - **Output:** `5`
   - **Explanation:** The last word is `"World"` with length `5`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** `s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "`
   - **Output:** `4`
   - **Explanation:** The last word is `"moon"` with length `4`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** `s = "luffy is still joyboy"`
   - **Output:** `6`
   - **Explanation:** The last word is `"joyboy"` with length `6`.

## **Function Definition**

In Python, the problem is typically solved by implementing the `lengthOfLastWord` function. Here's the standard function signature:

```python
def lengthOfLastWord(s: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the length of the last word in the string s.
    
    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string containing words and spaces.
    
    Returns:
    int: The length of the last word. Returns 0 if no words are present.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `s` (`str`): The input string containing words and spaces.

- **Returns:**
  - An integer representing the **length** of the last word in the string.
  - Returns `0` if the string contains no words.

## **Function Calls**

Here are some examples of how to call the `lengthOfLastWord` function with different inputs:

```python
# Example 1
result1 = lengthOfLastWord("Hello World")
print(result1)  # Output: 5

# Example 2
result2 = lengthOfLastWord("   fly me   to   the moon  ")
print(result2)  # Output: 4

# Example 3
result3 = lengthOfLastWord("luffy is still joyboy")
print(result3)  # Output: 6

# Additional Example: No Words
result4 = lengthOfLastWord("    ")
print(result4)  # Output: 0

# Additional Example: Single Word
result5 = lengthOfLastWord("OpenAI")
print(result5)  # Output: 6
```

## **High-Level Solution**

### **Approach: Reverse Traversal**

**Idea:**  
Traverse the string from the end to efficiently locate the last word by skipping any trailing spaces and then counting the characters of the last word.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialize a Counter:**
   - Start with a counter set to `0` to keep track of the length of the last word.

2. **Traverse the String in Reverse:**
   - Iterate through the string `s` from the last character to the first.

3. **Skip Trailing Spaces:**
   - While the current character is a space (`' '`), continue moving left to skip any trailing spaces.

4. **Count the Last Word:**
   - Once a non-space character is found, start counting the characters of the last word by incrementing the counter.
   - Continue moving left and incrementing the counter until a space is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached.

5. **Return the Counter:**
   - The counter now holds the length of the last word. Return this value.

**Advantages of This Approach:**

- **Efficiency:**  
  Traverses the string only once from the end, making it time-efficient with a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

- **Space Optimal:**  
  Uses constant extra space **O(1)**, as it only requires a few variables for tracking.

- **Handles Edge Cases Gracefully:**  
  Effectively manages cases with multiple trailing spaces, single-word strings, and empty strings.

## **Python Implementation**

Here's how you can implement the **Reverse Traversal Approach** in Python:

```python
def lengthOfLastWord(s: str) -> int:
    length = 0
    i = len(s) - 1

    # Skip trailing spaces
    while i >= 0 and s[i] == ' ':
        i -= 1

    # Count the length of the last word
    while i >= 0 and s[i] != ' ':
        length += 1
        i -= 1

    return length
```

### **Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `length` to keep track of the last word's length.
   - `i` as the index starting from the end of the string.

2. **Skip Trailing Spaces:**
   - The first `while` loop moves the index `i` leftwards past any spaces at the end of the string.

3. **Count Characters of the Last Word:**
   - The second `while` loop increments `length` for each non-space character encountered, effectively counting the last word's characters.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - After counting, `length` holds the length of the last word, which is returned.

## **Conclusion**

The **Reverse Traversal Approach** is highly recommended for solving the "Length of Last Word" problem due to its **efficiency** and **simplicity**. By traversing the string from the end, it quickly identifies and counts the last word without unnecessary computations, making it both time and space optimal.
