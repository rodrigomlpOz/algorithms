Yes, you can solve the **Top K Frequent Elements** problem using just a **hashmap** (dictionary) and a **bucket sort** approach without using a heap. This is more efficient for this specific problem, especially when dealing with frequency counts, and achieves an O(n) time complexity.

### Approach Using Hashmap and Bucket Sort:
1. **Frequency Count with Hashmap**:
   - Use a hashmap to count the frequency of each element in the input array `nums`. The keys in the hashmap are the elements from the array, and the values are their respective frequencies.
   
2. **Bucket Sort**:
   - Since the frequency of any element can range from `1` to `n` (where `n` is the length of `nums`), we can create an array of size `n+1` (buckets) where the index represents the frequency. Each index will store a list of elements that appear that many times.
   
3. **Return the Top K Frequent Elements**:
   - Traverse the buckets from the highest frequency to the lowest, and collect the elements until you have the top `k` most frequent elements.

### Code Implementation:

```python
import collections

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> list[int]:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each element using a hashmap
        frequency_map = collections.Counter(nums)  # O(n) time
        
        # Step 2: Create a list of empty buckets where index represents frequency
        bucket = [[] for _ in range(len(nums) + 1)]
        
        # Step 3: Place the numbers into the corresponding bucket based on frequency
        for num, freq in frequency_map.items():
            bucket[freq].append(num)
        
        # Step 4: Gather the top k frequent elements from the buckets
        result = []
        for i in range(len(bucket) - 1, 0, -1):
            if bucket[i]:
                result.extend(bucket[i])
            if len(result) >= k:
                return result[:k]  # Return exactly k elements
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Frequency Count**: 
   - We use `collections.Counter(nums)` to count the frequency of each element in `nums`. This creates a hashmap (frequency map) where the keys are the elements and the values are their counts.

2. **Bucket Sort**:
   - We create an array of empty lists called `bucket`. The length of the array is `len(nums) + 1` because the maximum possible frequency of any element is `len(nums)`.
   - For each element in the frequency map, we add the element to the corresponding bucket index that represents its frequency. For example, if an element appears `3` times, we put it in `bucket[3]`.

3. **Gathering Top K Elements**:
   - We start from the last index (which represents the highest frequency) and collect the elements into the `result` list. We continue this process until we have gathered at least `k` elements, which we return.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
```python
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
k = 2
sol = Solution()
print(sol.topKFrequent(nums, k))  # Output: [3, 2]
```
- **Step 1**: Frequency map: `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}`
- **Step 2**: Bucket: `[[], [1], [2], [3]]`
- **Step 3**: Start from the end of the bucket, collect `[3]` and `[2]`.

#### Example 2:
```python
nums = [7, 7]
k = 1
sol = Solution()
print(sol.topKFrequent(nums, k))  # Output: [7]
```
- **Step 1**: Frequency map: `{7: 2}`
- **Step 2**: Bucket: `[[], [], [7]]`
- **Step 3**: Start from the end, collect `[7]`.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. We perform the frequency count in O(n), and placing elements in buckets and collecting the top `k` elements also takes O(n).
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since we use a hashmap to store the frequencies and a bucket array of size `n+1`.

### Conclusion:
This approach leverages the hashmap for frequency counting and a bucket sort method to efficiently retrieve the top `k` frequent elements in O(n) time complexity, without the need for a heap.
