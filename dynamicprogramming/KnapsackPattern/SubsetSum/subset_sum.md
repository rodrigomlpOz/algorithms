### Problem: **Subset Sum Problem**

**Problem Statement**:
Given a set of non-negative integers and a target sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with a sum equal to the target sum.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2], target = 9
Output: True
Explanation: A subset with sum 9 is [4, 5].
```

```plaintext
Input: nums = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2], target = 30
Output: False
Explanation: No subset has sum 30.
```

---

### Function Definition:

```python
def subsetSum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if there is a subset of the given numbers that sums up to the target sum.

    Args:
    nums: List of non-negative integers.
    target: The target sum.

    Returns:
    True if a subset with the target sum exists, False otherwise.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for actual implementation
```

### Function Calls:

```python
# Test case 1: A subset with sum 9 exists
nums = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2]
target = 9
print(subsetSum(nums, target))  # Output: True

# Test case 2: No subset with sum 30 exists
nums = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2]
target = 30
print(subsetSum(nums, target))  # Output: False

# Test case 3: Subset sum 0 exists by picking no elements
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 0
print(subsetSum(nums, target))  # Output: True
```

### High-Level Solution:

The **Subset Sum Problem** is a variation of the **Knapsack problem** where the goal is to determine whether a subset of a given set sums up to a specified target. This can be solved using **dynamic programming** (DP) by maintaining a DP table where each entry `dp[i][j]` represents whether it is possible to achieve the sum `j` using the first `i` elements of the array.

---

### Dynamic Programming Approach:

1. **Define the DP Table**:
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be a boolean value where `dp[i][j] = True` if a subset of the first `i` elements of `nums` can sum to `j`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = False`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - If the target sum is `0`, `dp[i][0] = True` for all `i` because the empty subset can always sum to 0.
   - If no elements are included, `dp[0][j] = False` for `j > 0`, because no sum can be made from an empty subset except for sum `0`.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each number `nums[i-1]`:
     - **Exclude the number**: If you donâ€™t include `nums[i-1]`, the solution is the same as `dp[i-1][j]`.
     - **Include the number**: If you include `nums[i-1]` and `j >= nums[i-1]`, then check if the remaining sum `j - nums[i-1]` can be made using the first `i-1` elements (`dp[i-1][j - nums[i-1]]`).

4. **Final Result**:
   - The answer will be stored in `dp[n][target]`, where `n` is the number of elements in the input list `nums`.

---

### Explanation:

1. **DP Table Setup**:
   - We create a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents whether it's possible to achieve the sum `j` using the first `i` numbers from `nums`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[i][0] = True` for all `i`, because a sum of `0` can be achieved with the empty subset.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each number `nums[i-1]`, we check whether we can achieve the sum `j` either by **excluding** or **including** the current number.
   
4. **Final Result**:
   - The answer is found in `dp[n][target]`, which tells us whether we can achieve the target sum using all `n` numbers.

---

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n * target)**: We iterate over each number and each possible sum from `1` to `target`.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n * target)**: We use a 2D DP table of size `(n + 1) x (target + 1)`.

---

### Example Walkthrough:

For `nums = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2]` and `target = 9`:

1. We start with the base case: `dp[i][0] = True` for all `i`.
2. For each element in `nums`, we fill the DP table based on whether or not we include the element.
3. The final result in `dp[6][9]` will be `True` because the subset `[4, 5]` sums to `9`.
