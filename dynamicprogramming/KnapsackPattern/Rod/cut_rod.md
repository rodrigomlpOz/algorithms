### Problem Description:
The **Rod Cutting Problem** is about maximizing the profit from cutting a rod of length `n`. Given a rod of length `n` and a list `price[]` where `price[i]` is the price of a rod of length `i+1`, you can cut the rod into smaller pieces. Each piece can have its own price, and the goal is to determine the maximum revenue obtainable by cutting the rod and selling the pieces.

### Function Definition:
```python
def rodCutting(price, n):
    """
    Solves the rod cutting problem using dynamic programming.

    Args:
    price : list : List of prices where price[i] is the price of a rod of length i+1.
    n : int : The length of the rod.

    Returns:
    int : The maximum profit obtainable by cutting the rod into pieces.
    """
    # Logic to be implemented below
    pass
```

### Function Calls:
```python
# Example calls to test the rodCutting function

price = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]  # Prices for rod lengths from 1 to 8
n = 8  # Total length of the rod
print(rodCutting(price, n))  # Expected output: 22

price = [3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]
n = 5
print(rodCutting(price, n))  # Expected output: 13
```

### High-Level Solution Description:

The **Rod Cutting problem** is a variation of the **0-1 Knapsack problem** where the goal is to maximize the revenue by cutting a rod into smaller pieces. We approach this problem using **dynamic programming** by breaking it down into subproblems.

1. **Define the DP Table:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the maximum profit that can be obtained by cutting a rod of length `j` using the first `i` possible piece lengths.
   - The table will be of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, where `n` is the length of the rod.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - If the length of the rod is 0, no revenue can be obtained, so we initialize `dp[i][0] = 0` for all `i`.
   - If no pieces are available (`i = 0`), the maximum revenue is also `0`, so initialize `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j`.

3. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - For each piece of length `i`, we have two choices:
     - **Include the piece**: If the piece length `i` can fit into the rod of length `j`, we add the value of this piece `price[i-1]` and check the remaining rod length (`j - i`).
     - **Exclude the piece**: Move to the next piece without cutting the rod at length `i`.
   - The relation is:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = \max(\text{price}[i-1] + dp[i][j-i], dp[i-1][j])
     \]
   - Here, `price[i-1]` is the price of cutting the rod at length `i` and `dp[i][j-i]` is the maximum value for the remaining rod length `j-i`.

4. **Iterating to Fill the DP Table:**
   - We iterate over all possible piece lengths `i` (from 1 to `n`) and over all possible rod lengths `j` (from 1 to `n`).
   - For each cell `dp[i][j]`, we compute the maximum revenue either by including or excluding the current piece of length `i`.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - The final result is stored in `dp[n][n]`, which represents the maximum profit for cutting a rod of length `n` using all possible piece lengths.

Great question! Let me clarify the meaning of **width** and **height** (i.e., the dimensions of the DP table) in the context of the **Rod Cutting Problem**.

### Explanation of Width and Height:

- **Height (`i`):** This represents the number of different **rod lengths** (or "pieces") we are considering. The variable `i` corresponds to the **index of the rod length**. For instance:
  - If `i = 1`, we are considering a rod of length 1.
  - If `i = 2`, we are considering a rod of length 2, and so on up to `n` (the full length of the rod).

  The height of the table corresponds to all possible rod lengths or pieces that we can use to cut the rod.

- **Width (`j`):** This represents the total **length of the rod** that we are currently working with. The variable `j` corresponds to the **remaining length of the rod** for which we want to find the optimal value.
  - For example, if `j = 1`, we are calculating the maximum profit for a rod of length 1.
  - If `j = 5`, we are calculating the maximum profit for a rod of length 5.

  The width of the table corresponds to the lengths of the rod from `0` to `n` that we are cutting.

### Key Idea:
The goal is to use all the different available piece lengths (`i`) to maximize the total profit for a rod of length `j`. The height `i` represents the different lengths of rod pieces we are considering, and the width `j` represents the current length of the rod we want to maximize profit for.

---

### Example:

Let's say the prices for each rod length are as follows:
- `price = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]`
- The total rod length `n = 8`.

Now we create a DP table with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`:
- **Rows (`i`)** represent rod lengths (the pieces we can use). Each row `i` corresponds to considering piece lengths from 1 to `i`.
- **Columns (`j`)** represent the length of the rod for which we're calculating the maximum profit.

### DP Table:

Here's how the DP table works:
- **Rows (i):** Represent the different lengths of the pieces we can use to cut the rod. If `i = 3`, we are considering pieces of length 1, 2, and 3.
- **Columns (j):** Represent the current length of the rod. If `j = 5`, we are calculating the maximum profit for a rod of length 5.

### How to Fill the DP Table:
- At `dp[i][j]`, you are considering the maximum revenue obtainable by cutting a rod of length `j` using pieces of length 1 to `i`.
- The goal is to fill the entire table using the recurrence relation until you reach the cell `dp[n][n]`, which holds the final answer.

Hereâ€™s how the DP table might look for a rod of length `8`:

| i \ j | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|   0   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
|   1   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|   2   | 0 | 1 | 5 | 6 | 10|11 |15 |16 |20 |
|   3   | 0 | 1 | 5 | 8 | 10|13 |16 |18 |22 |
|   4   | 0 | 1 | 5 | 8 | 10|13 |16 |18 |22 |
|   5   | 0 | 1 | 5 | 8 | 10|13 |17 |18 |22 |
|   6   | 0 | 1 | 5 | 8 | 10|13 |17 |18 |22 |
|   7   | 0 | 1 | 5 | 8 | 10|13 |17 |18 |22 |
|   8   | 0 | 1 | 5 | 8 | 10|13 |17 |18 |22 |

### Detailed Walkthrough:

1. **Row 0 (i = 0):**
   - Represents the base case where no pieces are available. So, for any length of the rod (`j = 0, 1, 2,...n`), the profit is `0`.

2. **Row 1 (i = 1):**
   - We are considering pieces of length 1.
   - If the rod length `j = 1`, the maximum value is `price[0] = 1`.
   - For `j = 2`, we can either cut two pieces of length 1 (yielding a value of `2`).
   - This continues until `j = 8`, where we get a value of `8` by cutting eight pieces of length 1.

3. **Row 2 (i = 2):**
   - We now consider pieces of length 1 and 2.
   - For `j = 2`, using the piece of length 2 gives a profit of `5` (which is better than two pieces of length 1).
   - For `j = 3`, we choose between using a piece of length 2 plus a piece of length 1 (yielding a profit of `6`), or using only length 1 pieces (profit of `3`).
   - We continue filling the table until `j = 8`, where the maximum profit is `20` by cutting the rod using pieces of length 2.

4. **Row 3 and beyond:**
   - Similarly, we proceed by considering larger pieces (e.g., pieces of length 3, 4, etc.) and fill the table according to the recurrence relation.

At the end, `dp[8][8]` gives the maximum profit, which is `22`.

### Recap:
- **Height (i)** represents the available piece lengths.
- **Width (j)** represents the length of the rod we're trying to maximize profit for.

I hope this clears up the meaning of the width and height in the DP table! Let me know if you have any further questions.
