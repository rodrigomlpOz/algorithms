### Problem: **Combination Sum IV**

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array of distinct integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, your task is to return the number of possible combinations that add up to the target. The same number can be used multiple times in the combination, and the order of numbers in different combinations matters.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
The possible combinations are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
(1, 3)
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- All elements of `nums` are distinct.
- `1 <= target <= 1000`

### Function Definition:
```python
def combinationSum4(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    """
    Function to find the number of possible combinations that add up to the target.

    Args:
    nums: List[int] - An array of distinct integers.
    target: int - The target integer.

    Returns:
    int - The number of possible combinations that add up to the target.
    """
```

### Function Calls:
```python
# Example 1
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4
print(combinationSum4(nums, target))  # Output: 7

# Example 2
nums = [2, 3, 6, 7]
target = 7
print(combinationSum4(nums, target))  # Output: 2

# Example 3
nums = [4, 2, 1]
target = 32
print(combinationSum4(nums, target))  # Output: (some large number)
```

### High-Level Solution:

This problem can be approached using **Dynamic Programming** (DP) to count how many combinations sum up to the target. The key observation is that this is a **combinatorial counting** problem, and the order of elements in the combination matters, meaning different permutations of the same numbers count as different combinations.

#### Steps to Solve:
1. **DP Array**:
   - Define a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to sum up to `i` using the elements of `nums`.
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 1` because there is exactly one way to make a sum of `0` (by using no elements).

2. **Transition**:
   - For each number `i` from `1` to `target`, check all numbers in `nums`. If `i >= num`, then we can use `num` in the combination, and the number of ways to make the sum `i` is increased by `dp[i - num]` (i.e., the number of ways to make the sum `i - num`).

3. **Result**:
   - The result will be stored in `dp[target]`, which gives the number of combinations that sum to `target`.

### Explanation:
1. **DP Array Initialization**:
   - `dp[0] = 1`: There's exactly one way to make a sum of 0, which is to pick no numbers.
   - All other entries `dp[i]` are initialized to `0` because initially, we haven't counted any ways to make those sums.

2. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - For each sum `i` from `1` to `target`, we check all numbers in `nums`. If the current number `num` can contribute to the sum `i` (i.e., `i >= num`), then we add `dp[i - num]` to `dp[i]`. This is because the number of ways to make sum `i` includes all the ways to make sum `i - num`, plus `num` itself.
   
   - This process ensures that we count every combination of numbers that sum to `i`.

3. **Result**:
   - After filling the `dp` array, the value at `dp[target]` will give the number of possible combinations to sum to `target`.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(target * n)**: We iterate over each sum from `1` to `target`, and for each sum, we check all `n` numbers in `nums`.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(target)**: We use a DP array of size `target + 1` to store the number of combinations for each sum.

### Example Walkthrough:

For `nums = [1, 2, 3]` and `target = 4`:

1. Initialize `dp = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
2. For `i = 1`:
   - Add `dp[1 - 1]` (for `1`): `dp[1] = 1`.
3. For `i = 2`:
   - Add `dp[2 - 1]` (for `1`): `dp[2] = 1`.
   - Add `dp[2 - 2]` (for `2`): `dp[2] = 2`.
4. For `i = 3`:
   - Add `dp[3 - 1]` (for `1`): `dp[3] = 2`.
   - Add `dp[3 - 2]` (for `2`): `dp[3] = 3`.
   - Add `dp[3 - 3]` (for `3`): `dp[3] = 4`.
5. For `i = 4`:
   - Add `dp[4 - 1]` (for `1`): `dp[4] = 4`.
   - Add `dp[4 - 2]` (for `2`): `dp[4] = 6`.
   - Add `dp[4 - 3]` (for `3`): `dp[4] = 7`.

Thus, the answer for `target = 4` is `dp[4] = 7`.
