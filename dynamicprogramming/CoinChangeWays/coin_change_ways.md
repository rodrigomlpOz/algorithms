### Problem Definition:
You are given an integer array `coins` representing different denominations of coins and an integer `amount` representing a target amount of money. Your task is to determine how many unique ways you can make the `amount` using the coins, where each coin can be used an infinite number of times.

If it is not possible to make the `amount` using any combination of coins, return `0`.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
- `amount = 5`
- `coins = [1, 2, 5]`

**Output:** `4`

**Explanation:** There are four ways to make up the amount 5:
1. 5 = 5
2. 5 = 2 + 2 + 1
3. 5 = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1
4. 5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

### Example 2:
**Input:**
- `amount = 3`
- `coins = [2]`

**Output:** `0`

**Explanation:** There is no way to make up the amount 3 with only the coin denomination of 2.

### Function Definition:

```python
def coin_change_ways(amount, coins):
    """
    A function to calculate the number of ways to make up a given amount using the provided coins.
    
    Args:
    amount: int - The target amount of money.
    coins: List[int] - A list of coin denominations.
    
    Returns:
    int - The number of unique ways to make up the amount using the coins.
    """
    pass  # Logic will go here
```

### Function Calls:

```python
# Example test cases
amount = 5
coins = [1, 2, 5]
print(coin_change_ways(amount, coins))  # Expected output: 4

amount = 3
coins = [2]
print(coin_change_ways(amount, coins))  # Expected output: 0

amount = 10
coins = [1, 2, 5]
print(coin_change_ways(amount, coins))  # Expected output: 10
```

### High-Level Solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - We will create a 1D DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to make the amount `i` using the given coins.
   - The size of the `dp` array will be `amount + 1` because we need to calculate all ways to make amounts from `0` to `amount`.

2. **Base Case:**
   - `dp[0] = 1`: There is exactly 1 way to make the amount `0`, which is by using no coins at all.

3. **Transition:**
   - For each coin in `coins`, we iterate through all possible amounts from the coin's value up to the target `amount`. For each amount `i`, we update `dp[i]` by adding `dp[i - coin]`, because the number of ways to make `i` includes the number of ways to make `i - coin` plus the current coin.

4. **Iterating Over Coins:**
   - For each coin in the list of coins, we update the number of ways to make each possible amount.
   - We avoid recomputation by iterating over each coin once and updating the relevant entries in the DP table.

5. **Final Result:**
   - After iterating through all coins, the value in `dp[amount]` will represent the total number of ways to make the target `amount`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `amount = 0`, the function should return `1` because there's one way to make `0` (by using no coins).
   - If the `coins` list is empty and `amount > 0`, return `0` because no amount can be made.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the number of ways to make the target amount using all possible combinations of the given coins, with a time complexity of **O(amount * number of coins)**.
