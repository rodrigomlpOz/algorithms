### Problem Statement:
Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in `s`. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

### Example:
**Input:**  
`s = "cbbd"`

**Output:**  
`2`

**Explanation:**  
The longest palindromic subsequence is `"bb"`.

### Function Definition:

```python
def longest_palindrome_subseque(s):
    """
    Function to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a string.

    Args:
    s: str - Input string.

    Returns:
    int - Length of the longest palindromic subsequence.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for the actual implementation
```

---

### Function Calls:

```python
# Test Case 1
s = "cbbd"
ans = longest_palindrome_subseque(s)
print(ans)  # Expected output: 2

# Test Case 2
s = "bbbab"
ans = longest_palindrome_subseque(s)
print(ans)  # Expected output: 4 (the longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb")

# Test Case 3
s = "abcd"
ans = longest_palindrome_subseque(s)
print(ans)  # Expected output: 1 (the longest palindromic subsequence is any single character)
```

---

### Recursive Relation:

To solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach, we use the following recursive relation:

1. **Base Case:**  
   - A single character is always a palindrome of length `1`. Therefore, `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `i`.

2. **Recursive Case:**
   - If the characters at positions `i` and `j` are the same (`s[i] == s[j]`), then they contribute to the palindromic subsequence. Thus, the length of the longest palindromic subsequence is:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2
     \]
   - If the characters are not the same (`s[i] != s[j]`), then the longest palindromic subsequence will be the maximum of either:
     - The subsequence obtained by excluding the character at `i`: `dp[i+1][j]`
     - The subsequence obtained by excluding the character at `j`: `dp[i][j-1]`
     \[
     dp[i][j] = \max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])
     \]

3. **Final Result:**
   - The length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the entire string `s` is stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the string.

### High-Level Process:

1. **Define a DP Table:**
   - Create a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]` where each entry stores the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.

2. **Base Case:**
   - Initialize the diagonal of the DP table (`dp[i][i] = 1`), as each single character is a palindrome.

3. **Fill the DP Table:**
   - Use the recursive relation to fill the table from shorter substrings to longer ones.

4. **Return the Final Result:**
   - The final result is the value in `dp[0][n-1]`, which gives the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the string `s`.

This approach ensures an efficient way to find the longest palindromic subsequence using dynamic programming.\

Certainly! Visualizing the loops can be tricky, so let's go through an example step-by-step with a string. I'll show how the loops work and how the DP table is filled.

### Example: `s = "cbbd"`

The string is `"cbbd"`, and we want to fill the DP table to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

The DP table `dp[i][j]` will store the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for each substring `s[i:j+1]`.

### Step-by-Step Visualization of the DP Table Filling:

- We have `n = 4` because the length of the string is 4.
- The DP table is initially filled with zeros, and we will fill it step-by-step.

### Initial DP Table:

We start by filling the base case: every single character is a palindrome of length `1`.

```
  c   b   b   d
c[1, 0, 0, 0]
b[0, 1, 0, 0]
b[0, 0, 1, 0]
d[0, 0, 0, 1]
```

### Outer Loop `i = 3 → 0` and Inner Loop `j = i+1 → n`:

Now, we start from the last row (`i = 3`) and move upwards to fill the table.

#### **1. Outer Loop `i = 2`:**
We are now considering the row where `i = 2`, which means we are focusing on substrings starting with the third character (`s[2]`).

- **Inner Loop `j = 3`:**
  - We are comparing the characters `s[2]` (`b`) and `s[3]` (`d`).
  - Since `b != d`, we calculate `dp[2][3] = max(dp[3][3], dp[2][2]) = max(1, 1) = 1`.

After this step:

```
  c   b   b   d
c[1, 0, 0, 0]
b[0, 1, 0, 0]
b[0, 0, 1, 1]
d[0, 0, 0, 1]
```

#### **2. Outer Loop `i = 1`:**
We move to `i = 1`, focusing on substrings starting with the second character (`s[1]`).

- **Inner Loop `j = 2`:**
  - We compare the characters `s[1]` (`b`) and `s[2]` (`b`).
  - Since `b == b`, we calculate `dp[1][2] = dp[2][1] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 2`.

- **Inner Loop `j = 3`:**
  - We compare the characters `s[1]` (`b`) and `s[3]` (`d`).
  - Since `b != d`, we calculate `dp[1][3] = max(dp[2][3], dp[1][2]) = max(1, 2) = 2`.

After this step:

```
  c   b   b   d
c[1, 0, 0, 0]
b[0, 1, 2, 2]
b[0, 0, 1, 1]
d[0, 0, 0, 1]
```

#### **3. Outer Loop `i = 0`:**
We move to the last iteration of the outer loop (`i = 0`), focusing on substrings starting with the first character (`s[0]`).

- **Inner Loop `j = 1`:**
  - We compare the characters `s[0]` (`c`) and `s[1]` (`b`).
  - Since `c != b`, we calculate `dp[0][1] = max(dp[1][1], dp[0][0]) = max(1, 1) = 1`.

- **Inner Loop `j = 2`:**
  - We compare the characters `s[0]` (`c`) and `s[2]` (`b`).
  - Since `c != b`, we calculate `dp[0][2] = max(dp[1][2], dp[0][1]) = max(2, 1) = 2`.

- **Inner Loop `j = 3`:**
  - We compare the characters `s[0]` (`c`) and `s[3]` (`d`).
  - Since `c != d`, we calculate `dp[0][3] = max(dp[1][3], dp[0][2]) = max(2, 2) = 2`.

After this step:

```
  c   b   b   d
c[1, 1, 2, 2]
b[0, 1, 2, 2]
b[0, 0, 1, 1]
d[0, 0, 0, 1]
```

### Final Result:

The value at `dp[0][3] = 2` is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the string `"cbbd"`.

### Summary of the Loops:

1. **Outer loop (i):** The outer loop goes from `i = n-1` (last character) to `i = 0` (first character). This ensures that we are solving subproblems (substrings) in increasing order of size.
  
2. **Inner loop (j):** For each `i`, the inner loop runs from `j = i + 1` to `j = n - 1`, covering all possible substrings starting at `i`.

By filling the table in this manner, the algorithm ensures that all smaller subproblems (smaller substrings) are solved before solving the larger subproblems. The end result is stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, which represents the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string.

### How the DP Table Helps:

- The table helps avoid recalculating the longest subsequences for overlapping substrings by storing previously computed results.
- The approach ensures that the algorithm only fills the table once, leading to an efficient **O(n^2)** time complexity.

I hope this explanation helps you better understand how the loops work! Let me know if you'd like further clarification on any specific part.
