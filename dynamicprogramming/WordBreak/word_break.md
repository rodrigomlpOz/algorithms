### Problem Definition (Word Break):
You are given a string `s` and a list of words `wordDict` representing a dictionary. The task is to determine if `s` can be segmented into a sequence of one or more words from `wordDict`. Each word from the dictionary can be used multiple times.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
- `s = "applepenapple"`
- `wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]`

**Output:** `True`

**Explanation:**  
The string can be segmented as `"apple pen apple"`, where both `"apple"` and `"pen"` are in the dictionary.

### Example 2:
**Input:**
- `s = "catsandog"`
- `wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]`

**Output:** `False`

**Explanation:**  
The string cannot be segmented fully using the words from the dictionary.

### Recursive Solution (High-Level Description):

1. **Recursive Approach:**
   - The recursive approach breaks the string into smaller substrings and checks whether the prefix of the string exists in the dictionary.
   - For each valid prefix, the function recursively checks the remainder of the string.

2. **Base Case:**
   - If the string is empty, return `True` because an empty string can be segmented trivially.

3. **Recursive Step:**
   - Iterate over all possible prefixes of the string. If a prefix exists in the dictionary, recursively check the remainder of the string.
   - If any recursive call returns `True`, return `True` for the current substring. If no valid segmentation is found, return `False`.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - This solution can be inefficient due to overlapping subproblems, leading to an exponential time complexity of **O(2^n)**, where `n` is the length of the string.

### Dynamic Programming (DP) Solution (High-Level Description):

1. **DP Table Definition:**
   - We define a DP array `dp`, where `dp[i]` is `True` if the substring `s[:i]` can be segmented using words from the dictionary.
   - The goal is to determine whether the entire string `s` can be segmented, which will be stored in `dp[len(s)]`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The base case is `dp[0] = True` because an empty string can always be segmented.

3. **Filling the DP Table:**
   - Iterate through the string and for each valid starting position `i`, check all possible substrings `s[i:j]`.
   - If `dp[i]` is `True` (i.e., the substring `s[:i]` can be segmented), check if the substring `s[i:j]` exists in the dictionary. If it does, mark `dp[j]` as `True`.

4. **Final Result:**
   - After processing the entire string, the value of `dp[len(s)]` will tell whether the string can be segmented using the words from `wordDict`.

5. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the DP solution is **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`, because we check each substring multiple times.

### Function Definition:

```python
def word_break(s, wordDict):
    """
    Recursive approach to check if the string can be segmented.
    """
    pass  # Implementation of the recursive approach goes here

def word_break_dp(s, wordDict):
    """
    Dynamic programming approach to check if the string can be segmented.
    """
    pass  # Implementation of the DP approach goes here
```

### Function Calls:

```python
# Example 1
s = "applepenapple"
wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
print(word_break_dp(s, wordDict))  # Expected output: True

# Example 2
s = "catsandog"
wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
print(word_break_dp(s, wordDict))  # Expected output: False
```

### High-Level Comparison:

1. **Recursive Approach:**
   - The recursive solution tries every possible segmentation of the string by exploring all possible prefixes and recursively checking the remaining substring.
   - This approach can be inefficient due to overlapping subproblems, resulting in a high time complexity.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The DP approach builds up the solution iteratively by storing whether each substring can be segmented.
   - It avoids recalculating subproblems by using a DP table, significantly reducing the time complexity to **O(n^2)**.

### Conclusion:
- **Recursive Approach:** Intuitive but inefficient due to overlapping subproblems.
- **DP Approach:** More efficient due to the memoization of intermediate results, providing a much better time complexity.
