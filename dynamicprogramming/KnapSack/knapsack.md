Here's the breakdown with only the function calls and the problem details, excluding the solution:

### Problem Statement:
Given a list of items with specific weights and values, and a knapsack with a fixed weight capacity, find the maximum total value that can be placed in the knapsack without exceeding the weight limit. The 0-1 knapsack problem restricts items to either being fully included or excluded (no partial items allowed).

### Function Definition:
```python
def knapSack(W, wt, val, n):
    """
    A recursive function to solve the 0-1 Knapsack Problem.

    Args:
    W : int : The total capacity of the knapsack.
    wt : list : List of item weights.
    val : list : List of item values corresponding to the weights.
    n : int : The number of items to choose from.

    Returns:
    int : The maximum value that can be obtained with the given capacity.
    """
    # Function body implementation will go here
    pass
```

### Function Calls:
```python
# List of item values and weights
val = [60, 100, 120]
wt = [10, 20, 30]

# Capacity of the knapsack
W = 50

# Number of items
n = len(val)

# Calling the function to calculate the maximum value
print(knapSack(W, wt, val, n))
```

### High-Level Description:
Here's an expanded high-level description of the solution:

### High-Level Solution Description:
The 0-1 Knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem. The goal is to select a subset of items such that the total weight does not exceed the given knapsack capacity, and the total value is maximized.

The problem can be approached recursively:

1. **Base Case:**
   - If there are no items left to consider (`n == 0`), or the capacity of the knapsack is exhausted (`W == 0`), the maximum value is `0` since no more items can be included.

2. **Recursive Decision:**
   - For each item `i`, there are two possibilities:
     - **Exclude the item**: Simply skip this item and move to the next. The maximum value would then depend on the remaining items (`n-1`) and the same knapsack capacity (`W`).
     - **Include the item**: If the weight of the item is less than or equal to the remaining knapsack capacity, you can include this item. The remaining capacity is reduced by the weight of this item (`W - wt[i-1]`), and you add the value of this item to the total value.
     
3. **Optimization:**
   - For each item, you compute the maximum value by considering both including and excluding the item. The optimal solution is the one that maximizes the total value.
   - You recursively call the function to check all possible combinations and return the maximum of the two scenarios (including or excluding the current item).

4. **Key Idea:**
   - The recursive process explores all possible combinations of including and excluding items.
   - The solution is "naive" because it recalculates the result for the same subproblems multiple times. This leads to an exponential time complexity of `O(2^n)` since there are two decisions (include or exclude) for each item.

5. **Outputs:**
   - The final result of the function will be the maximum total value that can be achieved by selecting a subset of items while staying within the weight limit `W`.

### Example Walkthrough:
For example, given the items:
- Values: `[60, 100, 120]`
- Weights: `[10, 20, 30]`
- Knapsack capacity: `W = 50`

The function will:
1. Consider whether to include or exclude the third item (weight 30, value 120).
2. If excluded, the problem reduces to the first two items with the same capacity (`W = 50`).
3. If included, the capacity reduces to `W = 20`, and the function solves for the first two items with the reduced capacity.
4. The maximum value between these two options is returned.

This process continues recursively for all items, eventually finding the optimal combination.

Sure! Let's go through the iteration of forming the DP table step by step for the provided example:

### Problem Setup
- **Capacity of knapsack (`W`)**: 50
- **Weights (`wt`)**: [10, 20, 30]
- **Values (`val`)**: [60, 100, 120]
- **Number of items (`n`)**: 3

We will build a table `dp` where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value that can be obtained using the first `i` items with a weight limit `w`.

### Initialization
Before any iterations, the table `dp` will look like this, with dimensions `(n+1) x (W+1)`, initialized to 0:

| i\w | 0  | 1  | 2  | ... | 10 | ... | 20 | ... | 30 | ... | 50 |
| --- |----|----|----|-----|----|-----|----|-----|----|-----|----|
| 0   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  |
| 1   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  |
| 2   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  |
| 3   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  |

Initially, the table is filled with zeros because no items are chosen yet.

### Iteration 1: Considering the first item (weight 10, value 60)

For each weight capacity `w` from 0 to 50, we either include or exclude the first item. If we exclude it, the value stays the same as before (which is 0). If we include it, we check if its weight (`wt[0] = 10`) fits and add its value (`val[0] = 60`).

#### Key points for `i = 1`:
- For `w = 0` to `w = 9`, we can't include the item because its weight (10) exceeds the capacity.
- For `w = 10` to `w = 50`, we can include the item, and the value becomes 60.

| i\w | 0  | 1  | 2  | ... | 10 | 11 | ... | 20 | ... | 30 | ... | 50 |
| --- |----|----|----|-----|----|----|-----|----|-----|----|-----|----|
| 0   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  |
| 1   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 60 | 60 | ... | 60 | ... | 60 | ... | 60 |
| 2   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  |
| 3   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  |

### Iteration 2: Considering the second item (weight 20, value 100)

Now we add the second item. For each weight `w`, we either:
1. Exclude the item and take the value from the previous row (`dp[1][w]`), or
2. Include the item, but only if it fits in the knapsack. If included, we add its value (`100`) to the value for the remaining capacity (`w - wt[1]`).

#### Key points for `i = 2`:
- For `w = 0` to `w = 19`, we can't include the item because its weight (20) exceeds the capacity. The value stays the same as in row 1.
- For `w = 20` to `w = 29`, including the second item gives us a total value of 100 (just the second item).
- For `w = 30` to `w = 50`, including the second item gives a total value of `60 + 100 = 160` (including both the first and second items).

| i\w | 0  | 1  | 2  | ... | 10 | 11 | ... | 20 | 21 | ... | 30 | ... | 50 |
| --- |----|----|----|-----|----|----|-----|----|----|-----|----|-----|----|
| 0   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  |
| 1   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 60 | 60 | ... | 60 | 60 | ... | 60 | ... | 60 |
| 2   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 60 | 60 | ... |100 |100 | ... |160 | ... |160 |
| 3   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | ... | 0  |

### Iteration 3: Considering the third item (weight 30, value 120)

Finally, we add the third item. We either:
1. Exclude the item and take the value from the previous row (`dp[2][w]`), or
2. Include the item, but only if it fits in the knapsack. If included, we add its value (`120`) to the value for the remaining capacity (`w - wt[2]`).

#### Key points for `i = 3`:
- For `w = 0` to `w = 29`, we can't include the third item because its weight (30) exceeds the capacity. The value stays the same as in row 2.
- For `w = 30` to `w = 39`, including the third item gives us a total value of 120 (just the third item).
- For `w = 40` to `w = 49`, including the third item gives a total value of `60 + 120 = 180` (including the first and third items).
- For `w = 50`, including all three items gives a total value of `60 + 100 + 120 = 220`.

| i\w | 0  | 1  | 2  | ... | 10 | 11 | ... | 20 | 21 | ... | 30 | 31 | ... | 50 |
| --- |----|----|----|-----|----|----|-----|----|----|-----|----|----|-----|----|
| 0   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  | 0  | ... | 0  |
| 1   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 60 | 60 | ... | 60 | 60 | ... | 60 | 60 | ... | 60 |
| 2   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 60 | 60 | ... |100 |100 | ... |160 |160 | ... |160 |
| 3   | 0  | 0  | 0  | ... | 60 | 60 | ... |100 |100 | ... |120 |120 | ... |220 |

### Final Answer
After filling the table, the answer to the problem is in the bottom-right corner of the table (`dp[3][50]`), which is 220.

This is the maximum value we can carry in the knapsack with a weight limit of 50.
