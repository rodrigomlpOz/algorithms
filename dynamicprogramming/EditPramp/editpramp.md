### Problem Definition:
Given two strings, `source` and `target`, find the minimum number of operations (insertions and deletions) needed to transform `source` into `target`. The goal is to output the transformation in a step-by-step format, where:
- **Insertions** are represented by `+<character>`.
- **Deletions** are represented by `-<character>`.
- The characters in the `source` and `target` strings that do not need to be modified should be output without any prefix.

### Function Definition:

```python
def diffBetweenTwoStrings(source, target):
    """
    A function to find the minimum number of operations required to transform
    source into target and return the sequence of transformations.
    
    Args:
    source : str : The original string to be transformed.
    target : str : The target string to transform into.
    
    Returns:
    str : A string representing the sequence of insertions, deletions, and unchanged characters.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here
```

### Function Calls:

```python
# Example test cases

source = "AB"
target = "ABDFFGH"
print(diffBetweenTwoStrings(source, target))  # Output: "A B +D +F +F +G +H"

source = "ABC"
target = "AXY"
print(diffBetweenTwoStrings(source, target))  # Output: "A -B -C +X +Y"

source = "ABCDEFG"
target = "ACEG"
print(diffBetweenTwoStrings(source, target))  # Output: "A -B C -D E -F G"
```

### High-Level Description:

1. **Objective:**
   - The goal is to compute the minimum number of operations needed to transform one string (`source`) into another (`target`). Each transformation can either be:
     - **Insertion**: Inserting a character into `source`.
     - **Deletion**: Deleting a character from `source`.
     - **No Change**: Keeping a character unchanged if it matches between `source` and `target`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp`):**
   - A 2D DP table `dp[i][j]` is constructed, where:
     - `i` is the number of characters from `source` considered.
     - `j` is the number of characters from `target` considered.
     - `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations needed to transform the first `i` characters of `source` into the first `j` characters of `target`.

3. **Initialization:**
   - If the `source` string is empty, we need to insert all characters from `target`. Therefore, `dp[0][j] = j`.
   - If the `target` string is empty, we need to delete all characters from `source`. Therefore, `dp[i][0] = i`.

4. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - If `source[i-1] == target[j-1]`, no operation is needed, and we inherit the result from `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If `source[i-1] != target[j-1]`, we compute the minimum cost of:
     - **Insertion**: Adding the character `target[j-1]` to `source`.
     - **Deletion**: Removing the character `source[i-1]` from `source`.

   This gives the recurrence relation:
   \[
   dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i-1][j] + 1, dp[i][j-1] + 1)
   \]

5. **Backtracking for the Result:**
   - After the DP table is filled, we backtrack from `dp[len(source)][len(target)]` to reconstruct the sequence of operations:
     - If characters match, we append the character without changes.
     - If they don't match, we decide whether to insert or delete based on the minimum cost from the DP table.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The function returns the sequence of transformations in the format: characters, insertions (`+`), and deletions (`-`), representing the steps needed to transform `source` into `target`.

This approach efficiently computes the transformation sequence with **O(m * n)** time complexity, where `m` is the length of `source` and `n` is the length of `target`. The space complexity is also **O(m * n)** due to the DP table.
