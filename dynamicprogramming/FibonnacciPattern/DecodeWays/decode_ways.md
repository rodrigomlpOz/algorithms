### Problem Statement:

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. The decoding follows this mapping:

```
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
```

The task is to count all possible ways to decode a given string.

### Function Definition:

```python
def numDecodings(s: str) -> int:
    """
    This function takes a string s composed of digits and returns the number of ways it can be decoded 
    according to the given mapping where 'A' -> '1' and 'Z' -> '26'.
    
    Args:
    s (str): A string of digits representing an encoded message.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of ways the string can be decoded.
    """
```

### Function Calls:

```python
# Test cases:
print(numDecodings("12"))  # Output: 2 (can be decoded as "AB" or "L")
print(numDecodings("226"))  # Output: 3 (can be decoded as "BZ", "VF", or "BBF")
print(numDecodings("0"))    # Output: 0 (no valid decoding for "0")
print(numDecodings("06"))   # Output: 0 (no valid decoding for "06")
```

### High-Level Description:

This problem can be solved using recursion and dynamic programming (DP). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Base Case**: 
   - If the string `s` is empty, there is 1 way to decode it (the empty string).
   - If the string starts with a '0', there are no valid ways to decode it, so we return 0.

2. **Recursive Case**: 
   - The current string `s` can be decoded either by taking one digit at a time (i.e., decode the first character and move on to the rest) or by taking two digits if the substring `s[:2]` is between "10" and "26".
   - If both options are valid, sum the number of ways for both the one-digit and two-digit cases.

3. **Recursive Definition**: 
   - `numDecodings(s)` is recursively computed by trying both one-digit and two-digit decoding (if possible).
   
4. **Efficiency Issue**: 
   - This naive recursion approach results in overlapping subproblems, leading to an exponential time complexity, which can be improved by adding memoization or converting it into a DP solution.


### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We iterate through the string once to fill the DP array.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We use a DP array of size `n+1`.
