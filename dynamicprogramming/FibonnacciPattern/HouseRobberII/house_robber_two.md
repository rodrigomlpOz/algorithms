### Problem: **House Robber II**

**Problem Statement:**

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, but adjacent houses have security systems connected, so if you rob two adjacent houses, the security systems will alert the police.

However, the street is arranged in a **circle**, meaning the first house and the last house are adjacent. This means you cannot rob both the first and last houses.

Your task is to determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

### Function Definition:
```python
def rob(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Function to compute the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from circularly arranged houses.

    Args:
    nums: List[int] - A list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money stashed in each house.

    Returns:
    int - The maximum money that can be robbed without alerting the police.
    """
```

### Example Function Calls:
```python
# Example 1
nums = [2, 3, 2]
print(rob(nums))  # Output: 3 (rob house 1 or house 3)

# Example 2
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
print(rob(nums))  # Output: 4 (rob house 1 and house 3)

# Example 3
nums = [0]
print(rob(nums))  # Output: 0 (no money to rob)
```

### High-Level Solution:

Since the houses are arranged in a **circle**, the first and the last houses are adjacent. This adds a complication to the problem compared to the original **House Robber** problem. If we rob the first house, we cannot rob the last house, and vice versa. Therefore, the problem can be reduced to two simpler problems:
1. Rob houses from index 0 to `n-2` (i.e., excluding the last house).
2. Rob houses from index 1 to `n-1` (i.e., excluding the first house).

Then, the solution is simply the maximum of these two results.

We can now reduce the problem to solving the **House Robber** problem for these two cases, where houses are arranged in a straight line (not a circle).

### Steps:
1. If there is only one house, rob it.
2. Use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed in two cases:
   - Exclude the last house (`nums[0]` to `nums[n-2]`).
   - Exclude the first house (`nums[1]` to `nums[n-1]`).
3. Return the maximum of the two.

### Dynamic Programming Subproblem:
For each subproblem (either excluding the first or last house), the DP relation is the same as the **House Robber** problem:
- `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])`, where `dp[i]` is the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to the `i`th house.


### Explanation:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no houses (`nums` is empty), return `0`.
   - If there's only one house, rob it since there are no adjacent houses.

2. **Dynamic Programming Subproblem**:
   - We use a helper function `rob_linear(houses)` that solves the basic **House Robber** problem in a linear arrangement.
   - This function uses a DP array `dp`, where `dp[i]` stores the maximum money that can be robbed from the first `i` houses.

3. **Two Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: Consider the subarray `nums[0]` to `nums[n-2]` (excluding the last house).
   - **Case 2**: Consider the subarray `nums[1]` to `nums[n-1]` (excluding the first house).

4. **Final Result**:
   - The solution is the maximum of the results from the two cases.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of houses. We solve two linear subproblems, each taking linear time.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)** due to the DP array used in each subproblem.

This solution ensures that you can rob the maximum amount of money from the houses while taking into account the circular arrangement.
