# 399. Evaluate Division

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Topics**: Graph Theory, Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Union-Find  
**Companies**: Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft

---

## **Problem Statement**

You are given:

- An array of variable pairs `equations`, where each `equations[i] = [Ai, Bi]` represents the equation **Ai / Bi = values[i]**.
- An array of real numbers `values`, where `values[i]` corresponds to the equation `Ai / Bi`.
- An array of queries `queries`, where each `queries[j] = [Cj, Dj]` asks for the result of **Cj / Dj**.

**Objective**: Return an array of results for each query. If the result cannot be determined, return `-1.0`.

**Notes**:

1. The input is always valid.
2. Evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero.
3. There are no contradictions in the equations.
4. Variables that do not appear in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.

## **Function Definition**

Here's the function signature you'll implement to solve the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def calcEquation(equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]) -> List[float]:
    """
    Calculates the result of division for each query based on the given equations and values.

    Args:
    - equations: List of equations represented as pairs of variables.
    - values: List of real numbers representing the division results of the equations.
    - queries: List of queries represented as pairs of variables.

    Returns:
    - List of results for each query. If a query cannot be determined, returns -1.0.
    """
    pass  # Implementation goes here

```

---

## **Walkthrough of Example 1**

Let's walk through **Example 1** to understand how the `calcEquation` function processes the input and arrives at the correct output.

### **Given Input**

```python
equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]]
values = [2.0, 3.0]
queries = [["a","c"], ["b","a"], ["a","e"], ["a","a"], ["x","x"]]
```

### **Expected Output**

```python
[6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
```

### **Step-by-Step Execution**

1. **Graph Construction**

   The function first constructs a graph based on the `equations` and `values`.

   - **Equation 1**: `"a" / "b" = 2.0`
     - Add an edge from `"a"` to `"b"` with a weight of `2.0`.
     - Add an edge from `"b"` to `"a"` with a weight of `1 / 2.0 = 0.5`.

   - **Equation 2**: `"b" / "c" = 3.0`
     - Add an edge from `"b"` to `"c"` with a weight of `3.0`.
     - Add an edge from `"c"` to `"b"` with a weight of `1 / 3.0 ≈ 0.3333`.

   - **Resulting Graph**:

     ```
     a --2.0--> b --3.0--> c
     b --0.5--> a
     c --0.3333--> b
     ```

2. **Processing Queries**

   The function processes each query using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to find a path from the numerator to the denominator and compute the product of the edge weights along that path.

   #### **Query 1: ["a", "c"]**

   - **Goal**: Compute `a / c`
   - **Steps**:
     1. Start at `"a"`.
     2. From `"a"`, move to `"b"` with a weight of `2.0`.
     3. From `"b"`, move to `"c"` with a weight of `3.0`.
     4. **Result**: `2.0 * 3.0 = 6.0`
   - **Output**: `6.0`

   #### **Query 2: ["b", "a"]**

   - **Goal**: Compute `b / a`
   - **Steps**:
     1. Start at `"b"`.
     2. From `"b"`, move to `"a"` with a weight of `0.5`.
     3. **Result**: `0.5`
   - **Output**: `0.5`

   #### **Query 3: ["a", "e"]**

   - **Goal**: Compute `a / e`
   - **Steps**:
     1. Check if `"e"` exists in the graph.
     2. `"e"` is **undefined**.
     3. **Result**: `-1.0`
   - **Output**: `-1.0`

   #### **Query 4: ["a", "a"]**

   - **Goal**: Compute `a / a`
   - **Steps**:
     1. Any variable divided by itself equals `1.0`.
     2. **Result**: `1.0`
   - **Output**: `1.0`

   #### **Query 5: ["x", "x"]**

   - **Goal**: Compute `x / x`
   - **Steps**:
     1. Check if `"x"` exists in the graph.
     2. `"x"` is **undefined**.
     3. **Result**: `-1.0`
   - **Output**: `-1.0`

3. **Summary of Results**

   | Query | Computation Steps                                      | Result  |
   |-------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|
   | a/c   | a → b (2.0) → c (3.0) → c = 6.0                       | **6.0** |
   | b/a   | b → a (0.5) → a = 0.5                                  | **0.5** |
   | a/e   | "e" is undefined                                       | **-1.0**|
   | a/a   | Same variable                                           | **1.0** |
   | x/x   | "x" is undefined                                       | **-1.0**|

   - **Final Output**: `[6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]`

## **Detailed Walkthrough**

Let's delve deeper into how the function handles **Query 1: ["a", "c"]**.

### **Query 1: ["a", "c"]**

- **Objective**: Compute `a / c`

- **Process**:

  1. **Start at "a"**:
     - **Visited Set**: `{"a"}`
     - **Neighbors of "a"**: `[("b", 2.0)]`

  2. **Move to "b"**:
     - **Current Product**: `2.0` (from "a" to "b")
     - **Visited Set**: `{"a", "b"}`
     - **Neighbors of "b"**: `[("a", 0.5), ("c", 3.0)]`

  3. **Move to "c"**:
     - **Current Product**: `2.0 * 3.0 = 6.0` (from "b" to "c")
     - **Visited Set**: `{"a", "b", "c"}`
     - **Reached Destination**: "c"

  4. **Return Result**: `6.0`

- **Outcome**: The path `a → b → c` yields a result of `6.0` for `a / c`.

### **Handling Undefined Variables**

- **Queries Involving Undefined Variables**: If either the numerator or denominator in a query does not exist in the graph, the function immediately returns `-1.0`.

  - **Example**: `a / e`
    - **"e"** is undefined.
    - **Result**: `-1.0`

### **Same Variable Queries**

- **Queries Where Numerator and Denominator Are the Same**: If both variables in the query are identical and the variable exists in the graph, the result is `1.0`.

  - **Example**: `a / a`
    - **"a"** exists.
    - **Result**: `1.0`

- **Undefined Variables**: If the variable is undefined, even if numerator and denominator are the same, the result is `-1.0`.

  - **Example**: `x / x`
    - **"x"** is undefined.
    - **Result**: `-1.0`

## **Visualization of the Graph**

To better understand the traversal and computation, here's a visual representation of the graph constructed from **Example 1**:

```
a --2.0--> b --3.0--> c
b --0.5--> a
c --0.3333--> b
```

- **Edges Explained**:
  - **a → b (2.0)**: Represents `a / b = 2.0`
  - **b → a (0.5)**: Represents `b / a = 0.5`
  - **b → c (3.0)**: Represents `b / c = 3.0`
  - **c → b (0.3333)**: Represents `c / b ≈ 0.3333`

### **Traversal for Query "a/c"**

1. **Start at "a"**:
   - **Current Value**: `1.0` (initial)
   - **Move to "b"**: Multiply by `2.0` → **Current Value**: `2.0`

2. **At "b"**:
   - **Move to "c"**: Multiply by `3.0` → **Current Value**: `6.0`

3. **Reached "c"**:
   - **Result**: `6.0`

---

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Each equation `A / B = k` is represented by two directed edges:
     - **A → B** with weight `k`
     - **B → A** with weight `1/k`

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Used to traverse the graph from the numerator to the denominator.
   - Multiplies the weights along the path to compute the division result.
   - Utilizes a `visited` set to avoid cycles and redundant computations.

3. **Handling Special Cases**:
   - **Undefined Variables**: Queries involving variables not present in the graph return `-1.0`.
   - **Same Variable Queries**: If both variables are the same and defined, the result is `1.0`. If undefined, `-1.0`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - **Time Complexity**:
     - **Graph Construction**: O(N), where N is the number of equations.
     - **Each Query**: O(N) in the worst case (traversing all nodes).
     - **Total**: O(N * Q), where Q is the number of queries.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(N), for storing the graph.

| a/e   | "e" is undefined                                       | **-1.0**|
| a/a   | Same variable                                           | **1.0** |
| x/x   | "x" is undefined                                       | **-1.0**|

- **Final Output**: `[6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]`
