### Problem Statement:

You are given two strings, `start` and `end`, representing the start and end gene sequences, respectively, where each gene sequence is a string of 8 characters. Each character in the gene sequence is one of the following: `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'`. You are also given a list of valid gene sequences called `bank`.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of mutations needed to transform the `start` gene sequence into the `end` gene sequence. A mutation is defined as a change in a single character at a specific position in the gene sequence. However, you can only mutate the gene if the result is present in the `bank`. 

If it is not possible to mutate the `start` gene into the `end` gene, return `-1`.

### Function Definition:

```python
def minMutation(start: str, end: str, bank: list[str]) -> int:
    """
    Determines the minimum number of mutations required to change
    the 'start' gene sequence to the 'end' gene sequence using only
    mutations available in the 'bank'. Returns -1 if not possible.

    Parameters:
    - start: A string representing the start gene sequence.
    - end: A string representing the end gene sequence.
    - bank: A list of valid gene sequences available for mutation.

    Returns:
    - The minimum number of mutations to reach the end sequence, or -1 if impossible.
    """
```

### Example Calls:

```python
start_gene = "AACCGGTT"
end_gene = "AAACGGTA"
gene_bank = ["AACCGGTA", "AACCGCTA", "AAACGGTA"]

# Call the function
result = minMutation(start_gene, end_gene, gene_bank)

# Expected output: 2 (Two mutations are needed to reach the end gene)
print(result)
```

### High-Level Solution:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - If the `end` gene sequence is not in the `bank`, immediately return `-1` since it would be impossible to reach.
   - Convert the `bank` to a set (`bank_set`) for O(1) lookups of valid gene mutations.
   - Initialize a queue for BFS (breadth-first search) traversal. The queue stores tuples of the form `(current_gene, mutation_count)`, where `mutation_count` tracks the number of mutations made so far.

2. **BFS Traversal**:
   - The goal is to explore all possible gene mutations level by level, starting from the `start` gene.
   - For each gene in the current level, mutate each of its characters to `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'`. If the mutated gene is in the `bank_set` and has not been visited, add it to the queue with an incremented mutation count.
   - If the mutated gene matches the `end` gene, return the current mutation count.

3. **End Condition**:
   - If the BFS completes without finding a valid mutation path, return `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to transform `start` into `end`.

### BFS ensures that the first time you reach the `end` gene, you have found the minimum number of mutations.
