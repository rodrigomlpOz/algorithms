Ah, you're referring to the "Max Area of Island" problem. Here’s the problem statement, function definition, and high-level approach for that:

**Problem Statement:**

You are given a 2D grid of 0s and 1s. An island is a group of connected 1s (horizontally or vertically connected). The grid is surrounded by water (0s). You need to find the area of the largest island. The area of an island is the number of 1s in that island. Return the maximum area of an island in the grid. If there is no island, return 0.

**Function Definition:**

```python
def max_area_of_island(grid):
    """
    Given a 2D grid, returns the maximum area of an island.
    
    Args:
    grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D list where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

    Returns:
    int: The area of the largest island.
    """
    # High-level idea:
    # - Initialize a variable to track the max area found.
    # - Traverse each cell in the grid. If the cell is '1', run DFS or BFS to
    #   calculate the connected island's area and update the max area.
    # - Mark visited cells to prevent recounting.
    
    # Edge cases: Empty grid, no islands (all 0s), etc.

    pass

# Example 1:
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
]
print(max_area_of_island(grid))  # Expected output: area of the largest island is 5

# Example 2:
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
]
print(max_area_of_island(grid))  # Expected output: 0 (no islands)

```

**Function Calls Example:**

```python
# Example 1:
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
]
print(max_area_of_island(grid))  # Expected output: (an integer representing the max area)

# Example 2:
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
]
print(max_area_of_island(grid))  # Expected output: (an integer representing the max area)
```

**High-Level Approach:**

1. **Goal**: The objective is to traverse the grid and find the largest connected component of 1s (which represents land), treating this as an island. For each island, compute its area, and track the largest area encountered.

2. **Traversing the Grid**: 
   - You’ll need to explore every cell in the grid. If the cell contains a `1`, initiate a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the connected components (neighboring 1s). 
   - For each 1 encountered in a connected group, increment the area count.

3. **DFS or BFS**: 
   - Use DFS/BFS to mark visited cells to avoid recounting them. You can either modify the grid by marking visited cells with a different value (like changing them to 0), or use a separate visited structure.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Grids with no 1s (all water).
   - Grids with only isolated 1s.
   - Grids where all cells are 1s.

5. **Termination**: After checking all cells, return the maximum area found.
