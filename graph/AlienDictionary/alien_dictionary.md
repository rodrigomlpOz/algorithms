### Problem Definition

The problem is to determine the order of characters in an alien language, given a list of words sorted according to the rules of that language. The goal is to return a string that represents the characters in the correct lexicographical order.

The task involves constructing a directed graph of character dependencies from the input list of words, then performing a topological sort to determine the character order. If there are cycles in the graph (i.e., conflicting dependencies), return an empty string.

### Function Definition

```python
class Solution(object):
    def alienOrder(self, words):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
```

### High-Level Steps

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - For each adjacent pair of words in the input list, determine the first differing character between them.
   - This differing character determines the ordering of characters: if character `a` from the first word precedes character `b` from the second word, then there is a directed edge from `a` to `b` in the graph.
   - Also, ensure all characters from the words are included as vertices in the graph, even if they donâ€™t appear in any dependencies.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) on the graph to check for cycles. If a cycle is found, the order of characters is invalid, and return an empty string.

3. **Topological Sorting**:
   - If no cycle is found, perform a topological sort using DFS. The resulting order is the lexicographical order of characters in the alien language.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the topologically sorted characters as a single string. If the graph is empty or there is a cycle, return an empty string.

### Example

```python
words = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]
sol = Solution()
result = sol.alienOrder(words)
print(result)  # Possible output: "wertf"
```

In this example, the order of characters can be deduced from the differences between adjacent words. The resulting order of characters in the alien language could be `"wertf"`.
