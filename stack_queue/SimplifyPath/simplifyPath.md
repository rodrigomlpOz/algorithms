### Problem Statement:
You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash (`/`). Your task is to simplify the path into its canonical form. In a Unix-style file system, the following rules apply:

1. A single period (`.`) refers to the current directory and can be ignored.
2. A double period (`..`) refers to the parent directory and moves up one directory level.
3. Multiple consecutive slashes (`//`) are treated as a single slash (`/`).
4. Any valid directory names should remain in the path.

Your goal is to return the **simplified canonical path**. The simplified path should:
- Always start with a single slash (`/`).
- Not contain multiple consecutive slashes.
- Not end with a slash (`/`) unless it is the root directory.
- Not contain `.` or `..` in the path.

### Function Signature:
```python
def simplifyPath(path: str) -> str:
```

### Function Calls:
```python
# Example 1:
path = "/home/"
print(simplifyPath(path))  # Output: "/home"

# Example 2:
path = "/../"
print(simplifyPath(path))  # Output: "/"

# Example 3:
path = "/home//foo/"
print(simplifyPath(path))  # Output: "/home/foo"

# Example 4:
path = "/a/./b/../../c/"
print(simplifyPath(path))  # Output: "/c"
```

### High-Level Solution:

1. **Split the Path**:
   - The first step is to split the input path by slashes (`/`) into components.
   - After splitting, we process each component:
     - If the component is empty (due to multiple slashes) or a single period (`.`), it is ignored.
     - If the component is a double period (`..`), we pop the last directory from the stack (if available) to move up one directory level.
     - Otherwise, the component is treated as a valid directory and added to the stack.

2. **Handle Special Cases**:
   - If the input path is just `/` or contains `..` that go beyond the root, we ensure that the stack is not affected or emptied completely.
   
3. **Rebuild the Simplified Path**:
   - After processing the path components, we rebuild the canonical path from the remaining directories in the stack. The result should always start with a slash (`/`) and should not end with a slash unless the result is `/`.

### Solution Code:

```python
def simplifyPath(path: str) -> str:
    # Split the path by slashes
    pass

```

### Explanation:

1. **Splitting the Path**:
   - We use `split('/')` to break the path into individual components.
   - Empty strings and `.` are ignored, as they don't affect the final path.

2. **Processing Components**:
   - If we encounter `..`, we pop the last directory from the stack (if any) to simulate moving up one directory.
   - Any valid directory names are pushed onto the stack.

3. **Rebuild the Path**:
   - After processing all components, the remaining valid directories in the stack are joined with `/` to form the canonical path.

### Example Walkthrough:

1. **Input**: `/a/./b/../../c/`
   - Split into components: `['', 'a', '.', 'b', '..', '..', 'c', '']`
   - Processing:
     - Ignore `''`, `'a'` goes onto the stack → `['a']`
     - Ignore `'.'`
     - `'b'` goes onto the stack → `['a', 'b']`
     - `'..'` pops `'b'` → `['a']`
     - `'..'` pops `'a'` → `[]`
     - `'c'` goes onto the stack → `['c']`
   - Rebuild path: `/c`
   - **Output**: `/c`

2. **Input**: `/../`
   - Split into components: `['', '..', '']`
   - Processing:
     - `'..'` has no effect since we're at the root
   - Rebuild path: `/`
   - **Output**: `/`

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input path. We process each character once when splitting and processing components.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)** for storing the split components and the stack used to keep track of valid directories.

This solution ensures that the path is efficiently simplified to its canonical form according to Unix file system rules.
