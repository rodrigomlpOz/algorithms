### Problem Statement:

You are given an encoded string `s`, and your task is to decode it. The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is repeated exactly `k` times. You may assume that the input string is always valid, meaning that there are no extra brackets and that `k` is a positive integer.

The encoded string can be nested multiple times.

### Function Signature:
```python
def decodeString(s: str) -> str:
```

### Example:
```python
# Example 1:
s = "3[a]2[bc]"
# Explanation: The string "a" is repeated 3 times, and "bc" is repeated 2 times. So, the output is "aaabcbc".
print(decodeString(s))  # Output: "aaabcbc"

# Example 2:
s = "3[a2[c]]"
# Explanation: "a2[c]" means "a" followed by "cc", repeated 3 times. So, the output is "accaccacc".
print(decodeString(s))  # Output: "accaccacc"

# Example 3:
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
# Explanation: The string "abc" is repeated 2 times, "cd" is repeated 3 times, and then "ef" is added at the end. So, the output is "abcabccdcdcdef".
print(decodeString(s))  # Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
```

### High-Level Solution:

1. **Stack-Based Parsing**:
   - We use a stack to keep track of nested or sequential encoded strings.
   - When encountering a `[` symbol, we push the current accumulated string (`alphas`) and the repeat count (`digits`) onto the stack.
   - When encountering a `]`, we pop the last string and repeat count from the stack, multiply the current string by the repeat count, and append it to the previous string.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - We go through the input string character by character:
     - If we see a digit, we accumulate it until we see a `[`, which marks the beginning of an encoded substring.
     - When we encounter a `[`, we push the accumulated characters and number onto the stack.
     - When we encounter a `]`, we pop from the stack, repeat the substring as required, and concatenate it with the previously stored string.
     - If it's a regular letter, we simply accumulate it into `alphas`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - Once all characters are processed, `alphas` contains the fully decoded string.
  
Let's walk through an example step by step to understand how the algorithm works.

### Example Input:
```python
s = "3[a2[c]]"
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize an empty stack `stack = []`.
   - We also initialize two empty strings: `alphas = ''` (to store the current string being decoded) and `digits = ''` (to store the multiplier).

2. **First Iteration:**
   - The first character is `'3'`, which is a digit.
   - We accumulate this digit into `digits`. Now, `digits = '3'`.

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - The next character is `'['`.
   - This means we've finished reading the multiplier (which is `3`), and we're starting an encoded substring.
   - We push the current `alphas` (which is still `''`) and `digits` (converted to an integer) onto the stack. So now, `stack = [('', 3)]`.
   - We reset both `alphas` and `digits` to empty: `alphas = ''`, `digits = ''`.

4. **Third Iteration:**
   - The next character is `'a'`, which is an alphabet.
   - We accumulate this into `alphas`. Now, `alphas = 'a'`.

5. **Fourth Iteration:**
   - The next character is `'2'`, which is a digit.
   - We accumulate this into `digits`. Now, `digits = '2'`.

6. **Fifth Iteration:**
   - The next character is `'['`.
   - This indicates the start of another encoded substring (nested inside the previous one).
   - We push the current `alphas` (which is `'a'`) and `digits` (converted to an integer) onto the stack. So now, `stack = [('', 3), ('a', 2)]`.
   - We reset both `alphas` and `digits` to empty: `alphas = ''`, `digits = ''`.

7. **Sixth Iteration:**
   - The next character is `'c'`, which is an alphabet.
   - We accumulate this into `alphas`. Now, `alphas = 'c'`.

8. **Seventh Iteration:**
   - The next character is `']'`.
   - This indicates the end of the current encoded substring.
   - We pop from the stack, getting the tuple `('a', 2)`. This tells us that the previous string was `'a'`, and we need to repeat the current string `'c'` 2 times.
   - We update `alphas` to be the concatenation of the previous string and the repeated string: `alphas = 'a' + 'c' * 2 = 'acc'`.

9. **Eighth Iteration:**
   - The next character is `']'`.
   - This indicates the end of the outer encoded substring.
   - We pop from the stack again, getting the tuple `('', 3)`. This tells us that the previous string was `''`, and we need to repeat the current string `'acc'` 3 times.
   - We update `alphas` to be the concatenation of the previous string and the repeated string: `alphas = '' + 'acc' * 3 = 'accaccacc'`.

10. **End of String:**
    - The string is fully processed, and the decoded string is `alphas = 'accaccacc'`.

### Final Output:
```python
"accaccacc"
```

### Visualization of Stack Operations:

- After `'3['`: Stack = `[('', 3)]`
- After `'a2['`: Stack = `[('', 3), ('a', 2)]`
- After first `']'`: Stack = `[('', 3)]`, `alphas = 'acc'`
- After second `']'`: Stack = `[]`, `alphas = 'accaccacc'`

This step-by-step process ensures that the nested encoded strings are decoded in the correct order, from the innermost to the outermost.
