### Problem Statement:
We need to evaluate a mathematical expression given in postfix (also known as Reverse Polish Notation or RPN) format. The expression is provided as a string where numbers and operators are separated by commas. The task is to compute the result by processing the expression from left to right and applying the operators as we encounter them.

### Function Definition:

The function `evaluate(expression)` is designed to take a string `expression` in postfix notation, split it into individual tokens using a comma as a delimiter, and compute the result by applying the appropriate operations in the correct order.

#### Input:
- `expression`: A string representing a mathematical expression in postfix notation. Numbers and operators are separated by commas.

#### Output:
- The function returns the final computed result (an integer).

### Function Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - An empty list `intermediate_results` is used as a stack to store numbers temporarily while processing the expression.
   - `delimiter = ','` is defined to specify how the string is split into individual tokens.
   - A dictionary `operators` is defined where keys are the mathematical operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') and values are anonymous functions (lambdas) that perform the corresponding operation.

2. **Processing the Expression**:
   - The function splits the expression using `expression.split(delimiter)`, which breaks the string into tokens based on commas.
   - The function iterates through the tokens. If a token is an operator (i.e., it's found in the `operators` dictionary), the last two numbers are popped from `intermediate_results`, the operation is applied, and the result is pushed back to the stack.
   - If the token is a number, it is converted to an integer and added to `intermediate_results`.

3. **Returning the Result**:
   - After processing all the tokens, the final result of the expression is the last remaining value in `intermediate_results`, which is returned.

### Function Calls:

Example 1:
```python
evaluate("3,4,+,2,*")  # Expected output: 14
```

Explanation:
- Split tokens: `['3', '4', '+', '2', '*']`
- `3` and `4` are pushed to the stack.
- When `+` is encountered, `4 + 3 = 7`, and `7` is pushed to the stack.
- `2` is pushed to the stack.
- When `*` is encountered, `7 * 2 = 14`, and `14` is pushed to the stack.
- The final result is `14`.

Example 2:
```python
evaluate("5,1,2,+,4,*,+,3,-")  # Expected output: 14
```

Explanation:
- Split tokens: `['5', '1', '2', '+', '4', '*', '+', '3', '-']`
- The operations follow the postfix order and result in `14`.

### High-Level Explanation:
The function processes a mathematical expression in postfix notation, utilizing a stack-based approach to evaluate operations. Numbers are pushed onto the stack, and when operators are encountered, the top two numbers are popped, the operation is applied, and the result is pushed back to the stack. This continues until all tokens are processed, and the final result is returned.
